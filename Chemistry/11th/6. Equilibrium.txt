# Equilibrium Notes Part 1: Introduction to 6.3

## Introduction to Equilibrium

- Equilibrium: State where opposing processes occur at the same rate, resulting in no net change
- In chemistry, equilibrium can be physical (e.g., phase changes) or chemical (involving reactions)
- Dynamic equilibrium: Continuous forward and reverse processes occurring at equal rates

## 6.1 Equilibrium in Physical Processes

### 6.1.1 Solid-Liquid Equilibrium
- Example: Ice and water at 273K and 1 atm pressure
- At equilibrium, rate of melting = rate of freezing
- Normal melting/freezing point: Temperature at which solid and liquid are in equilibrium at 1 atm

### 6.1.2 Liquid-Vapour Equilibrium
- Example: Water and water vapor in a closed container
- Equilibrium vapor pressure: Constant pressure exerted by vapor at a given temperature
- Normal boiling point: Temperature at which liquid and vapor are in equilibrium at 1 atm

### 6.1.3 Solid-Vapour Equilibrium
- Example: Iodine solid and vapor
- Sublimation: Direct conversion of solid to vapor

### 6.1.4 Equilibrium Involving Dissolution of Solids or Gases in Liquids
- Solubility equilibrium: Balance between dissolution and crystallization
- Henry's Law: The mass of a gas dissolved in a given mass of a solvent is proportional to the pressure of the gas above the solvent

### 6.1.5 General Characteristics of Equilibria Involving Physical Processes
- Occurs in closed systems at constant temperature
- Dynamic but stable condition
- Measurable properties remain constant
- Equilibrium is characterized by a constant value of a specific parameter

## 6.2 Equilibrium in Chemical Processes – Dynamic Equilibrium

- Chemical equilibrium: State where rates of forward and reverse reactions are equal
- Represented by double arrows (⇌)
- Example: N₂ + 3H₂ ⇌ 2NH₃
- Concentration of reactants and products become constant over time
- Dynamic nature: Both forward and reverse reactions continue to occur

## 6.3 Law of Chemical Equilibrium and Equilibrium Constant

- Law of Mass Action: At equilibrium, the ratio of product of concentration of products to product of concentration of reactants, each raised to the power of their stoichiometric coefficients, is constant
- For a general reaction: aA + bB ⇌ cC + dD
- Equilibrium constant (Kc) = [C]ᶜ[D]ᵈ / [A]ᵃ[B]ᵇ
- Kc is constant at a given temperature
- For gaseous reactions, equilibrium constant in terms of partial pressures (Kp) is used
- Relationship between Kc and Kp: Kp = Kc(RT)ᐭⁿ
  Where Δn = (number of moles of gaseous products) - (number of moles of gaseous reactants)
- R = gas constant, T = temperature in Kelvin

## Key Terms:
- Dynamic equilibrium: Equilibrium where forward and reverse processes occur at equal rates
- Vapor pressure: Pressure exerted by a vapor in equilibrium with its liquid
- Sublimation: Direct transition from solid to gas phase
- Henry's Law: Relates gas solubility to pressure
- Law of Mass Action: Defines the equilibrium constant
- Equilibrium constant (Kc): Ratio of product concentrations to reactant concentrations at equilibrium
- Kp: Equilibrium constant in terms of partial pressures

# Equilibrium Notes Part 2: 6.4 to 6.7

## 6.4 Homogeneous Equilibria

- Homogeneous equilibrium: All reactants and products are in the same phase
- Examples: 
  1. N₂(g) + 3H₂(g) ⇌ 2NH₃(g)
  2. CH₃COOC₂H₅(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + C₂H₅OH(aq)

### 6.4.1 Equilibrium Constant in Gaseous Systems
- For gaseous reactions, equilibrium constant can be expressed in terms of partial pressures (Kp)
- Relationship between Kc and Kp:
  Kp = Kc(RT)ᐭⁿ
  Where Δn = (moles of gaseous products) - (moles of gaseous reactants)
- For reactions with no change in number of moles of gases, Kp = Kc

## 6.5 Heterogeneous Equilibria

- Heterogeneous equilibrium: Reactants and products are in different phases
- Example: CaCO₃(s) ⇌ CaO(s) + CO₂(g)
- For heterogeneous equilibria involving solids or pure liquids, their concentrations are constant and omitted from the equilibrium constant expression
- Equilibrium constant for CaCO₃ decomposition: Kc = [CO₂]

## 6.6 Applications of Equilibrium Constants

### 6.6.1 Predicting the Extent of a Reaction
- Large Kc (>10³): Products predominate at equilibrium
- Small Kc (<10⁻³): Reactants predominate at equilibrium
- Kc between 10⁻³ and 10³: Significant amounts of both reactants and products

### 6.6.2 Predicting the Direction of the Reaction
- Reaction quotient (Q): Similar to Kc but uses non-equilibrium concentrations
- For aA + bB ⇌ cC + dD
  Q = [C]ᶜ[D]ᵈ / [A]ᵃ[B]ᵇ
- If Q < Kc: Reaction proceeds forward
- If Q > Kc: Reaction proceeds backward
- If Q = Kc: System at equilibrium

### 6.6.3 Calculating Equilibrium Concentrations
- Steps to calculate equilibrium concentrations:
  1. Write balanced equation
  2. Write expressions for Kc and Q
  3. Set up an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium)
  4. Solve for unknown concentrations

## 6.7 Relationship between Equilibrium Constant K, Reaction Quotient Q, and Gibbs Energy G

- Gibbs energy change (ΔG) relates to the equilibrium constant:
  ΔG° = -RT ln K
- At equilibrium: ΔG = 0 and Q = K
- General relationship: ΔG = ΔG° + RT ln Q
- Spontaneity of reaction:
  * If ΔG < 0: Reaction is spontaneous
  * If ΔG > 0: Reaction is non-spontaneous
  * If ΔG = 0: System at equilibrium

## Key Terms:
- Homogeneous equilibrium: Equilibrium where all species are in the same phase
- Heterogeneous equilibrium: Equilibrium involving species in different phases
- Partial pressure: Pressure exerted by an individual gas in a mixture
- Reaction quotient (Q): Ratio of concentrations of products to reactants at any point in the reaction
- Gibbs energy (G): Thermodynamic potential that measures the maximum reversible work that may be performed by a system at constant temperature and pressure

## Formulas to Remember:
1. Kp = Kc(RT)ᐭⁿ
2. Q = [C]ᶜ[D]ᵈ / [A]ᵃ[B]ᵇ
3. ΔG° = -RT ln K
4. ΔG = ΔG° + RT ln Q

# Equilibrium Notes Part 3: 6.8 to 6.10

## 6.8 Factors Affecting Equilibria

Le Chatelier's Principle: When a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change, the system shifts in a direction that tends to counteract the effect of the change.

### 6.8.1 Effect of Concentration Change
- Adding reactant: Equilibrium shifts forward
- Adding product: Equilibrium shifts backward
- Removing reactant: Equilibrium shifts backward
- Removing product: Equilibrium shifts forward

### 6.8.2 Effect of Pressure Change

- Decrease in pressure: Equilibrium shifts to side with more gas molecules
- No effect if equal number of gas molecules on both sides

### 6.8.3 Effect of Inert Gas Addition
- At constant volume: No effect on equilibrium
- At constant pressure: May shift equilibrium if number of gas molecules changes

### 6.8.4 Effect of Temperature Change
- Endothermic reaction: Increase in temperature shifts equilibrium forward
- Exothermic reaction: Decrease in temperature shifts equilibrium forward

### 6.8.5 Effect of a Catalyst
- Catalyst does not affect equilibrium position
- Catalyst increases rate of both forward and reverse reactions equally

# Equilibrium Notes Part 4: 6.11 to 6.13

## 6.11 Ionization of Acids and Bases

### 6.11.1 The Ionization Constant of Water and its Ionic Product
- Water self-ionization: H₂O + H₂O ⇌ H₃O⁺ + OH⁻
- Ionic product of water: Kw = [H₃O⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ at 298 K
- pH + pOH = 14 at 298 K

### 6.11.2 The pH Scale
- pH = -log[H⁺]
- pOH = -log[OH⁻]
- Acidic solution: pH < 7
- Basic solution: pH > 7
- Neutral solution: pH = 7

### 6.11.3 Ionization Constants of Weak Acids
- For weak acid HA: HA + H₂O ⇌ H₃O⁺ + A⁻
- Acid dissociation constant: Ka = [H₃O⁺][A⁻] / [HA]
- pKa = -log Ka

### 6.11.4 Ionization of Weak Bases
- For weak base B: B + H₂O ⇌ BH⁺ + OH⁻
- Base dissociation constant: Kb = [BH⁺][OH⁻] / [B]
- pKb = -log Kb

### 6.11.5 Relation between Ka and Kb
- For conjugate acid-base pair: Ka × Kb = Kw
- pKa + pKb = pKw = 14 (at 298 K)

### 6.11.6 Di- and Polybasic Acids and Di- and Polyacidic Bases
- Polyprotic acids have multiple dissociation steps, each with its own Ka
- Example: H₂CO₃ ⇌ H⁺ + HCO₃⁻ (Ka1)
           HCO₃⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + CO₃²⁻ (Ka2)

### 6.11.7 Factors Affecting Acid Strength
- Bond strength: Weaker H-A bond = stronger acid
- Bond polarity: More polar H-A bond = stronger acid
- Atomic size: Larger atom (down the group) = stronger acid

### 6.11.8 Common Ion Effect in the Ionization of Acids and Bases

### 6.11.9 Hydrolysis of Salts and the pH of their Solutions
- Salt of strong acid and strong base: Neutral (pH = 7)
- Salt of weak acid and strong base: Basic (pH > 7)

  For acidic buffer: pH = pKa + log([salt] / [acid])
  For basic buffer: pOH = pKb + log([salt] / [base])






# ********************************* Part 5 ****************************************

## 6.13 Solubility Equilibria of Sparingly Soluble Salts

- Sparingly soluble salts: Salts with very low solubility in water

### 6.13.1 Solubility Product Constant

- Solubility product (Ksp): Product of the concentrations of ions in a saturated solution, each raised to the power of its stoichiometric coefficient

For a salt MₓAy that dissociates as:
MₓAy ⇌ xMʸ⁺ + yAˣ⁻

Ksp = [Mʸ⁺]ˣ [Aˣ⁻]ʸ

- Molar solubility (S): Number of moles of solute that dissolve in 1 L of solution to form a saturated solution

Relationship between Ksp and S:
Ksp = xˣ yʸ S⁽ˣ⁺ʸ⁾

S = (Ksp / (xˣ yʸ))¹⁄⁽ˣ⁺ʸ⁾

Examples:
1. For AgCl ⇌ Ag⁺ + Cl⁻
   Ksp = [Ag⁺][Cl⁻] = S²

2. For Ag₂CrO₄ ⇌ 2Ag⁺ + CrO₄²⁻
   Ksp = [Ag⁺]² [CrO₄²⁻] = 4S³

### 6.13.2 Common Ion Effect on Solubility of Ionic Salts

- Common ion effect: Decrease in solubility of a sparingly soluble salt due to the presence of a common ion in solution

Example: Solubility of AgCl decreases when NaCl is added to the solution due to increased [Cl⁻]

- To calculate solubility in presence of common ion:
1. Write the Ksp expression
2. Substitute the known concentration of the common ion
3. Solve for the unknown concentration of the other ion
4. Use the concentration to calculate the solubility

Factors affecting solubility:
1. Temperature: Generally increases solubility (except for gases in liquids)
2. pH: Affects solubility of salts containing weak acid or base ions
3. Complex ion formation: Increases solubility

## Key Terms:
1. Sparingly soluble salt: Salt with very low solubility in water
2. Solubility product (Ksp): Product of ion concentrations in a saturated solution
3. Molar solubility (S): Moles of solute per liter in a saturated solution
4. Common ion effect: Decrease in solubility due to presence of a common ion
5. Complex ion: Ion formed by coordination of a metal ion with one or more molecules or ions

## Important Formulas:
1. Ksp = [Mʸ⁺]ˣ [Aˣ⁻]ʸ
2. Ksp = xˣ yʸ S⁽ˣ⁺ʸ⁾
3. S = (Ksp / (xˣ yʸ))¹⁄⁽ˣ⁺ʸ⁾
