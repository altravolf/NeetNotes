I apologize for the oversight. Here's the text with proper superscripts and subscripts:

Introduction to Periodic Classification of Elements

3.1 Why do we need to Classify Elements?

- As of 2024, 114 elements are known
- Studying individual elements and their compounds is difficult due to the large number
- Classification helps in systematic study and prediction of properties
- Aids in understanding chemical facts and discovering new elements

Key terms:
- Element: Basic unit of all types of matter

3.2 Genesis of Periodic Classification

1. Döbereiner's Triads (1829):
   - Groups of three elements with similar properties
   - Middle element's atomic weight ≈ average of other two
   - Example: (Li, Na, K), (Ca, Sr, Ba), (Cl, Br, I)

2. Newlands' Law of Octaves (1865):
   - Elements arranged in increasing order of atomic weights
   - Every eighth element had similar properties
   - Worked only up to calcium

3. Lother Meyer's Work:
   - Plotted physical properties vs atomic weight
   - Observed periodically repeated pattern

4. Mendeleev's Periodic Table (1869):
   - Arranged elements in order of increasing atomic weights
   - Elements with similar properties in same vertical column or group
   - Left gaps for undiscovered elements
   - Predicted properties of unknown elements (e.g., Eka-aluminium, Eka-silicon)

Key terms:
- Periodic Law (Mendeleev): The properties of elements are a periodic function of their atomic weights
- Group: Vertical column in the periodic table
- Period: Horizontal row in the periodic table

3.3 Modern Periodic Law and the Present Form of the Periodic Table

- Based on Henry Moseley's work (1913) on X-ray spectra
- Modern Periodic Law: The physical and chemical properties of elements are periodic functions of their atomic numbers
- Long form of Periodic Table:
  - 7 periods (horizontal rows)
  - 18 groups (vertical columns)
  - s-, p-, d-, and f-blocks

Key terms:
- Atomic number: Number of protons in the nucleus of an atom
- Period: Corresponds to the highest principal quantum number (n) of elements
- Group: Elements with similar outer electronic configurations

3.4 Nomenclature of Elements with Atomic Numbers > 100

- IUPAC system for naming elements
- Use numerical roots for digits 0-9 (see Table 3.4 in NCERT)
- Add "ium" at the end

Example: Element 120 would be named Unbinilium (Ubn)

3.5 Electronic Configurations of Elements and the Periodic Table

- Electronic configuration: Distribution of electrons in orbitals of an atom
- Aufbau principle: Electrons fill orbitals in order of increasing energy

a) Electronic Configurations in Periods:
   - First period: 2 elements (1s¹, 1s²)
   - Second period: 8 elements (2s and 2p orbitals filled)
   - Third period: 8 elements (3s and 3p orbitals filled)
   - Fourth period: 18 elements (4s, 3d, and 4p orbitals filled)
   - Fifth period: Similar to fourth
   - Sixth period: 32 elements (6s, 4f, 5d, and 6p orbitals filled)
   - Seventh period: Incomplete, similar to sixth

b) Groupwise Electronic Configurations:
   - Elements in the same group have similar valence shell configurations
   - Example: Group 1 (alkali metals) all have ns¹ configuration

Key terms:
- Valence electrons: Electrons in the outermost shell
- Core electrons: Inner electrons not involved in bonding
- Quantum numbers: n (principal), l (azimuthal), mₗ (magnetic), mₛ (spin)

Formulas:
- None specific to this section, but understanding of electron configurations is crucial

Note: Memorize the electron configurations of elements, especially for the main group elements (s- and p-block), as they are frequently asked in NEET.

Here are comprehensive notes for topics 3.6 and 3.7, tailored for NEET preparation:

3.6 Electronic Configurations and Types of Elements: s-, p-, d-, f- Blocks

3.6.1 The s-Block Elements
- Group 1 (alkali metals) and Group 2 (alkaline earth metals)
- Outermost configuration: ns¹ or ns²
- Highly reactive metals with low ionization enthalpies
- Form mostly ionic compounds (except Li and Be)

3.6.2 The p-Block Elements
- Groups 13 to 18
- Outermost configuration: ns²np¹ to ns²np⁶
- Include metals, non-metals, and metalloids
- Noble gases (Group 18) have completely filled valence shells

3.6.3 The d-Block Elements (Transition Elements)
- Groups 3 to 12
- General outer configuration: (n-1)d¹⁻¹⁰ns⁰⁻²
- Exception: Pd (4d¹⁰5s⁰)
- Characteristics: colored ions, variable oxidation states, paramagnetism, catalytic properties

3.6.4 The f-Block Elements (Inner-Transition Elements)
- Lanthanoids: Ce (Z=58) to Lu (Z=71)
- Actinoids: Th (Z=90) to Lr (Z=103)
- General configuration: (n-2)f¹⁻¹⁴(n-1)d⁰⁻¹ns²
- All are metals
- Actinoids are radioactive

3.6.5 Metals, Non-metals, and Metalloids
- Metals: Left side of periodic table, good conductors, malleable, ductile
- Non-metals: Top right of periodic table, poor conductors, brittle
- Metalloids: Along the zig-zag line, properties between metals and non-metals

Key terms:
- Valence electrons: Outermost electrons involved in bonding
- Ionization enthalpy: Energy required to remove an electron from a gaseous atom
- Oxidation state: Charge an atom would have if all bonds were ionic

3.7 Periodic Trends in Properties of Elements

3.7.1 Trends in Physical Properties

a) Atomic Radius
- Decreases across a period, increases down a group
- Measured by X-ray diffraction or other spectroscopic methods
- Covalent radius: Half the distance between two covalently bonded atoms
- Metallic radius: Half the distance between adjacent metal atoms in crystal

b) Ionic Radius
- Cations are smaller than parent atoms
- Anions are larger than parent atoms
- Isoelectronic species: Same number of electrons, different nuclear charge

c) Ionization Enthalpy (ΔᵢH)
- Energy required to remove an electron from a gaseous atom in ground state
- Generally increases across a period, decreases down a group
- Exceptions: Be > B, N > O
Formula: X(g) → X⁺(g) + e⁻, ΔᵢH

d) Electron Gain Enthalpy (ΔₑgH)
- Energy change when a neutral atom gains an electron
- Generally becomes more negative across a period, less negative down a group
- Exceptions: Group 2 and 18 elements have positive values
Formula: X(g) + e⁻ → X⁻(g), ΔₑgH

e) Electronegativity
- Ability of an atom to attract shared electrons in a chemical bond
- Increases across a period, decreases down a group
- Pauling scale: F assigned 4.0 (highest)

3.7.2 Periodic Trends in Chemical Properties

a) Periodicity of Valence or Oxidation States
- Valence: Number of electrons an atom uses in bonding
- Oxidation state: Charge assigned to an atom in a compound
- Generally increases across a period, then decreases

b) Anomalous Properties of Second Period Elements
- Li and Be show diagonal relationship with Mg and Al
- First element of each group (Li to F) differs from other group members
- Reasons: Small size, high charge/radius ratio, high electronegativity

3.7.3 Periodic Trends and Chemical Reactivity
- Reactivity related to ease of electron loss or gain
- Metals: Highest reactivity on left (alkali metals)
- Non-metals: Highest reactivity on right (halogens)
- Oxides: Basic on left, acidic on right, amphoteric in center

Key terms:
- Ground state: Lowest energy state of an atom
- Shielding effect: Inner electrons reduce the nuclear charge felt by outer electrons
- Effective nuclear charge: Actual nuclear charge minus shielding effect

Formulas:
1. Atomic radius trend: r = k/Z^(1/3), where k is a constant and Z is atomic number
2. Ionization enthalpy: E = RH[(Z-σ)²/n²], where RH is Rydberg constant, σ is shielding constant, n is principal quantum number

Note: Focus on understanding trends and their explanations, as NEET often asks questions about comparing properties of elements based on their position in the periodic table.
