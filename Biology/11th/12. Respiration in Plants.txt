Here are detailed notes for topics 12.1 to 12.3, suitable for NEET preparation:

12.1 Do Plants Breathe?

1. Plants do require O₂ for respiration and give out CO₂.

2. Unlike animals, plants have no specialized organs for gaseous exchange.

3. Gaseous exchange in plants:
   - Occurs through stomata (in leaves) and lenticels (in stems)
   - Each plant part takes care of its own gas exchange needs
   - Plants have lower respiratory rates compared to animals
   - During photosynthesis, O₂ is released within cells

4. Structure facilitating gaseous exchange:
   - Living cells in plants are located close to the surface
   - Stems have lenticels for gas exchange
   - Parenchyma cells in leaves, stems, and roots are loosely packed, creating interconnected air spaces

5. Respiration equation:
   C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂ → 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + Energy

6. Energy released during respiration is used to synthesize ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate), which serves as the energy currency of the cell.

12.2 Glycolysis

1. Definition: Partial oxidation of glucose to form two molecules of pyruvic acid.

2. Location: Occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell.

3. Presence: Found in all living organisms.

4. Origin of the term:
   - "Glyco" means sugar
   - "Lysis" means splitting

5. Also known as EMP pathway (named after Embden, Meyerhof, and Parnas).

6. In plants, glucose is derived from:
   - Sucrose (end product of photosynthesis)
   - Storage carbohydrates

7. Conversion of sucrose to glucose:
   Sucrose → Glucose + Fructose (catalyzed by invertase enzyme)

8. Steps of glycolysis:
   a. Phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate (uses 1 ATP)
   b. Isomerization to fructose-6-phosphate
   c. Phosphorylation to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (uses 1 ATP)
   d. Splitting into dihydroxyacetone phosphate and 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde (PGAL)
   e. Oxidation of PGAL to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (produces 2 NADH + H⁺)
   f. Conversion of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to 3-phosphoglyceric acid (produces 2 ATP)
   g. Conversion of 3-phosphoglyceric acid to 2-phosphoglycerate
   h. Conversion of 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)
   i. Conversion of PEP to pyruvic acid (produces 2 ATP)

9. Net ATP production: 2 ATP molecules per glucose molecule

10. Key product: Pyruvic acid

12.3 Fermentation

1. Definition: Incomplete oxidation of glucose under anaerobic conditions.

2. Occurs in: Many prokaryotes and unicellular eukaryotes.

3. Types of fermentation:
   a. Alcoholic fermentation (e.g., in yeast)
   b. Lactic acid fermentation (e.g., in some bacteria and animal muscles during exercise)

4. Alcoholic fermentation:
   - Pyruvic acid → CO₂ + Ethanol
   - Enzymes involved: Pyruvic acid decarboxylase and Alcohol dehydrogenase
   - NADH + H⁺ is oxidized to NAD⁺

5. Lactic acid fermentation:
   - Pyruvic acid → Lactic acid
   - Enzyme involved: Lactate dehydrogenase
   - NADH + H⁺ is oxidized to NAD⁺

6. Energy yield: Less than 7% of the energy in glucose is released

7. Hazards: Production of acid or alcohol

8. Net ATP synthesis: 2 ATP per glucose molecule

9. Limitations:
   - Yeasts die when alcohol concentration reaches about 13%
   - Maximum alcohol concentration in naturally fermented beverages is around 13%

Key terms:
- Invertase: Enzyme that converts sucrose into glucose and fructose
- Hexokinase: Enzyme that phosphorylates glucose to glucose-6-phosphate
- NADH + H⁺: Reduced form of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide, an important electron carrier
- NAD⁺: Oxidized form of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide
- Pyruvic acid decarboxylase: Enzyme involved in alcoholic fermentation
- Alcohol dehydrogenase: Enzyme involved in alcoholic fermentation
- Lactate dehydrogenase: Enzyme involved in lactic acid fermentation

   - Carbohydrates: RQ = 1.0
     Example: C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂ → 6CO₂ + 6H₂O
     RQ = 6CO₂ / 6O₂ = 1.0
   - Fats: RQ < 1.0
