# ******************* Part 1 ********************

Here are detailed notes for topics 7.1, 7.2, and 7.2.1, focusing on NEET preparation and including all terms, explanations, and examples from the NCERT text:

7.1 Organ and Organ System

1. Tissue: A group of similar cells along with intercellular substances that perform a specific function.

2. Organ: Formed when two or more types of tissues organize in a specific proportion and pattern. 
   Example: stomach, lung, heart, kidney

3. Organ System: When two or more organs perform a common function through physical and/or chemical interaction.
   Example: digestive system, respiratory system

4. Division of labor: Cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems split up work efficiently in multicellular organisms.

5. Evolutionary trend: The discernible trend in the complexity of organ and organ systems.

6. Morphology: Study of form or externally visible features.
   - In plants/microbes: Refers only to external features
   - In animals: Refers to the external appearance of organs or body parts

7. Anatomy: Study of internal organs in animals.

7.2 Frogs

1. Scientific classification:
   - Class: Amphibia
   - Phylum: Chordata

2. Common species in India: Rana tigrina

3. Habitat: Can live both on land and in freshwater

4. Body temperature regulation:
   - Cold-blooded (poikilotherms): Body temperature varies with the environment

5. Adaptive features:
   a. Camouflage: Ability to change color to hide from enemies
   b. Mimicry: Protective coloration
   c. Aestivation: Summer sleep in deep burrows to protect from extreme heat
   d. Hibernation: Winter sleep in deep burrows to protect from extreme cold

7.2.1 Morphology

1. Skin:
   - Smooth and slippery due to mucus
   - Always moist
   - Helps in absorbing water (frogs don't drink water)

2. Coloration:
   - Dorsal side: Generally olive green with dark irregular spots
   - Ventral side: Uniformly pale yellow

3. Body divisions: Head and trunk (no neck or tail)

4. Head features:
   - Nostrils: A pair above the mouth
   - Eyes: Bulged, covered by nictitating membrane (protects eyes underwater)
   - Tympanum: Membranous ear on either side of eyes for receiving sound signals

5. Limbs:
   - Forelimbs: Help in swimming, walking, leaping, and burrowing; end in four digits
   - Hind limbs: Larger and more muscular than forelimbs; end in five digits
   - Feet: Webbed digits for swimming

6. Sexual dimorphism:
   - Male frogs: Have vocal sacs for sound production and a copulatory pad on the first digit of forelimbs
   - Female frogs: Lack vocal sacs and copulatory pad

These notes cover the key points, terms, and examples from the NCERT text for topics 7.1, 7.2, and 7.2.1, which should be helpful for NEET preparation.







# ********************* Part 2 **********************

Here are detailed notes for topic 7.2.2 Anatomy, focusing on NEET preparation and including all terms, explanations, and examples from the NCERT text:

7.2.2 Anatomy

1. Digestive System:
   - Components: Alimentary canal and digestive glands
   - Alimentary canal is short (frogs are carnivores)
   - Parts: Mouth → Buccal cavity → Pharynx → Oesophagus → Stomach → Intestine → Rectum → Cloaca
   - Digestive glands:
     a. Liver: Secretes bile, stored in gall bladder
     b. Pancreas: Produces pancreatic juice with digestive enzymes
   - Tongue: Bilobed, used for capturing prey
   - Digestion process:
     a. Stomach: HCl and gastric juices begin digestion
     b. Duodenum: Receives bile and pancreatic juices
     c. Intestine: Final digestion and absorption through villi and microvilli
   - Waste elimination: Through cloaca

2. Respiratory System:
   - Aquatic respiration: Through skin (cutaneous respiration)
   - Terrestrial respiration: 
     a. Buccal cavity
     b. Skin
     c. Lungs (pulmonary respiration)
   - Lungs: Pair of elongated, pink, sac-like structures in the upper trunk
   - During aestivation and hibernation: Gaseous exchange through skin

3. Circulatory System:
   - Closed type, well-developed
   - Components: Heart, blood vessels, blood
   - Lymphatic system also present
   - Heart: 
     a. Three-chambered: Two atria, one ventricle
     b. Covered by pericardium
     c. Sinus venosus: Triangular structure joining right atrium
     d. Conus arteriosus: Sac-like structure on ventral side
   - Blood composition: Plasma and cells (RBCs, WBCs, platelets)
   - RBCs: Nucleated, contain haemoglobin
   - Special venous connections:
     a. Hepatic portal system: Between liver and intestine
     b. Renal portal system: Between kidney and lower body parts

4. Excretory System:
   - Components: Pair of kidneys, ureters, cloaca, urinary bladder
   - Kidneys: Bean-shaped, dark red, located posteriorly on both sides of vertebral column
   - Functional unit: Uriniferous tubules or nephrons
   - Frogs are ureotelic (excrete urea)

5. Nervous System:
   - Central nervous system: Brain and spinal cord
   - Peripheral nervous system: Cranial and spinal nerves
   - Autonomic nervous system: Sympathetic and parasympathetic
   - Brain divisions:
     a. Forebrain: Olfactory lobes, cerebral hemispheres, diencephalon
     b. Midbrain: Optic lobes
     c. Hindbrain: Cerebellum and medulla oblongata
   - Cranial nerves: 10 pairs
   - Spinal cord: Enclosed in vertebral column

6. Sense Organs:
   - Touch: Sensory papillae
   - Taste: Taste buds
   - Smell: Nasal epithelium
   - Vision: Eyes (simple eyes with one unit)
   - Hearing: Tympanum with internal ears (also for balance)

7. Endocrine System:
   - Glands: Pituitary, thyroid, parathyroid, thymus, pineal body, pancreatic islets, adrenals, gonads

8. Reproductive System:
   - Male reproductive organs:
     a. Testes: Pair of yellowish ovoid structures
     b. Vasa efferentia: 10-12 in number, connect testes to kidneys
     c. Bidder's canal: Connects vasa efferentia to urinogenital duct
     d. Urinogenital duct: Opens into cloaca
   - Female reproductive organs:
     a. Ovaries: Pair near kidneys
     b. Oviducts: Open into cloaca separately
   - Fertilization: External, in water
   - Egg-laying capacity: 2500-3000 ova at a time
   - Development: Involves larval stage (tadpole)
   - Metamorphosis: Tadpole transforms into adult frog

These notes cover all the key points, terms, and examples from the NCERT text for topic 7.2.2, which should be helpful for NEET preparation.
