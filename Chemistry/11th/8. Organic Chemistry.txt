Here are the notes for sections 8.5 and 8.6, formatted for NEET preparation:

8.5 Nomenclature of Organic Compounds

8.5.1 The IUPAC System of Nomenclature

Rules for naming branched alkanes:
1. Identify longest carbon chain (parent chain)
2. Number the carbon atoms to give lowest numbers to substituents
3. Name alkyl groups as prefixes to parent alkane
4. Use di-, tri-, tetra- etc. for multiple identical substituents
5. List different substituents alphabetically
6. Use numbers to indicate substituent positions, separated by commas

Examples:
- CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃ : Octane
- (CH₃)₃C-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃ : 2,2,4-Trimethylpentane

Alkyl groups:
- Methyl (-CH₃), Ethyl (-CH₂CH₃), Propyl (-CH₂CH₂CH₃)
- Isopropyl [CH₃-CH(CH₃)-], sec-Butyl [CH₃-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-]
- Isobutyl [(CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-], tert-Butyl [(CH₃)₃C-]

Cyclic Compounds:
- Prefix "cyclo-" to the alkane name
Example: Cyclohexane, 3-Ethyl-1,1-dimethylcyclohexane

8.5.3 Nomenclature of Organic Compounds having Functional Group(s)
- Identify principal functional group (highest priority)
- Name parent chain including principal functional group
- Other groups named as prefixes

Functional Group Priorities (decreasing order):
-COOH, -SO₃H, -COOR, -COCl, -CONH₂, -CN, -CHO, >C=O, -OH, -NH₂, >C=C<, -C≡C-

Example: HOCH₂(CH₂)₃CH₂COCH₃ : 7-Hydroxyheptan-2-one

8.5.4 Nomenclature of Substituted Benzene Compounds
- Name substituents as prefixes to "benzene"
- For disubstituted: Use numbers or ortho- (1,2), meta- (1,3), para- (1,4)
- For tri- or higher substituted: Use numbers only

Examples:
- Methylbenzene (Toluene)
- 1,3-Dibromobenzene (m-Dibromobenzene)
- 4-Ethyl-2-methylaniline
