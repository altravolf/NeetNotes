Here are concise notes for topics 13.1 to 13.3, suitable for NEET preparation, including key terms, explanations, and examples from the NCERT text:

13.1 Growth

Definition: Irreversible permanent increase in size of an organ/part/cell, accompanied by metabolic processes.

Key Points:
1. Indeterminate Growth: 
   - Plants retain capacity for unlimited growth due to meristems
   - Open form of growth: new cells continuously added by meristem activity
   - Types: Primary growth (elongation) and Secondary growth (girth increase)

2. Measurable Growth:
   - Parameters: Fresh/dry weight, length, area, volume, cell number
   - Example: Maize root apical meristem can produce 17,500 new cells/hour
   - Example: Watermelon cells can increase in size by 350,000 times

3. Phases of Growth:
   a) Meristematic: Constant cell division, thin cell walls, dense cytoplasm
   b) Elongation: Increased vacuolation, cell enlargement, new cell wall deposition
   c) Maturation: Cells reach maximum size, wall thickening, protoplasmic modifications

4. Growth Rates:
   a) Arithmetic Growth: 
      - Linear curve when plotted
      - Formula: Lt = L0 + rt
      - Example: Root elongation at constant rate
   b) Geometric Growth:
      - Exponential curve (sigmoid curve in natural conditions)
      - Phases: Lag, log (exponential), and stationary
      - Formula: W1 = W0ert

5. Conditions for Growth:
   - Water, oxygen, nutrients, optimal temperature, light, gravity

13.2 Differentiation, Dedifferentiation and Redifferentiation

1. Differentiation:
   - Cells from meristems mature to perform specific functions
   - Structural changes in cell walls and protoplasm
   - Example: Tracheary elements lose protoplasm, develop strong lignified walls

2. Dedifferentiation:
   - Differentiated cells regain division capacity
   - Example: Formation of interfascicular cambium from parenchyma cells

3. Redifferentiation:
   - Dedifferentiated cells mature again to perform specific functions
   - Example: Secondary xylem and phloem formation from vascular cambium

4. Open Differentiation:
   - Cells from same meristem can differentiate into different structures
   - Example: Root apical meristem produces root cap and epidermis

13.3 Development

Definition: All changes an organism goes through during its life cycle from seed germination to senescence.

Key Points:
1. Plasticity: 
   - Ability to follow different pathways in response to environment/life phases
   - Example: Heterophylly in cotton, coriander, larkspur (juvenile vs. mature leaf shapes)
   - Example: Buttercup leaves in air vs. water (environmental heterophylly)

2. Factors Affecting Development:
   a) Intrinsic: Intracellular (genetic) and intercellular (plant growth regulators)
   b) Extrinsic: Light, temperature, water, oxygen, nutrition

3. Relationship: Development = Growth + Differentiation

Here are concise notes for topic 13.4 Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs), suitable for NEET preparation, including key terms, explanations, and examples from the NCERT text:

13.4 Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs)

Definition: Small, simple molecules of diverse chemical composition that influence physiological processes in plants.

13.4.1 Characteristics:
- Also called plant growth substances, plant hormones, or phytohormones
- Types: Indole compounds, adenine derivatives, carotenoid derivatives, terpenes, gases
- Categories: Growth promoters (auxins, gibberellins, cytokinins) and growth inhibitors (abscisic acid, ethylene)

13.4.2 Discovery of PGRs:
1. Auxins: Charles Darwin's phototropism experiments in grass coleoptiles
2. Gibberellins: Discovery linked to 'bakanae' (foolish seedling) disease in rice
3. Cytokinins: Identified during studies on tobacco stem callus proliferation
4. Abscisic Acid: Initially identified as dormin, inhibitor-B, and abscission II
5. Ethylene: Observed effect on fruit ripening in bananas

13.4.3 Physiological Effects of PGRs:

1. Auxins:
   - Natural: IAA (Indole-3-acetic acid), IBA (Indole butyric acid)
   - Synthetic: NAA (Naphthalene acetic acid), 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid)
   Effects:
   - Promote rooting in stem cuttings
   - Induce flowering (e.g., pineapples)
   - Prevent early fruit and leaf drop
   - Cause apical dominance
   - Induce parthenocarpy (e.g., tomatoes)
   - Used as weedicides (e.g., 2,4-D for dicot weeds)
   - Control xylem differentiation and cell division

2. Gibberellins:
   - Over 100 forms: GA1, GA2, GA3 (Gibberellic acid), etc.
   Effects:
   - Increase stem length (e.g., grape stalks)
   - Promote fruit elongation (e.g., apples)
   - Delay senescence
   - Speed up malting process in brewing
   - Increase sugarcane yield
   - Promote early seed production in conifers
   - Induce bolting in rosette plants (e.g., cabbage)

3. Cytokinins:
   - Natural: Zeatin
   - Synthetic: Kinetin
   Effects:
   - Promote cell division (cytokinesis)
   - Induce new leaf production and chloroplast formation
   - Promote lateral shoot growth
   - Overcome apical dominance
   - Delay leaf senescence
   - Enhance nutrient mobilization

4. Ethylene:
   - Gaseous PGR
   - Synthetic source: Ethephon
   Effects:
   - Promote horizontal growth in seedlings
   - Induce swelling of the axis and apical hook formation in dicot seedlings
   - Promote senescence and abscission of leaves and flowers
   - Induce fruit ripening and respiratory climactic
   - Break seed and bud dormancy
   - Promote root growth and root hair formation
   - Induce flowering in mango and pineapple
   - Promote female flower production in cucumbers

5. Abscisic Acid (ABA):
   Effects:
   - Inhibit seed germination
   - Stimulate stomatal closure
   - Increase plant stress tolerance (stress hormone)
   - Induce seed dormancy
   - Antagonistic to gibberellins in most processes

Key Points:
- PGRs can have multiple effects on plants
- Different PGRs can have similar effects
- PGRs can act synergistically or antagonistically
- PGRs interact with environmental factors (e.g., light, temperature) to control plant development
