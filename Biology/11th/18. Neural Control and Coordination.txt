Here are the complete notes with all superscripts and subscripts corrected:

Introduction to Neural Control and Coordination

1. Coordination: Process through which two or more organs interact and complement each other's functions.
   Example: During physical exercise
   - Energy demand increases
   - Oxygen supply increases
   - Respiration rate increases
   - Heart beat rate increases
   - Blood flow increases
   - After exercise, all organ functions gradually return to normal

2. Two systems for coordination:
   a) Neural system: Provides quick point-to-point connections
   b) Endocrine system: Provides chemical integration through hormones

18.1 Neural System

1. Definition: Composed of highly specialized cells called neurons
2. Function: Detect, receive, and transmit different kinds of stimuli
3. Evolution of neural systems:
   a) Lower invertebrates (e.g., Hydra): Simple network of neurons
   b) Insects: More organized with brain, ganglia, and neural tissues
   c) Vertebrates: Most developed neural system

18.2 Human Neural System

1. Two main divisions:
   a) Central Neural System (CNS)
      - Includes brain and spinal cord
      - Site of information processing and control
   b) Peripheral Neural System (PNS)
      - All nerves associated with CNS
      - Two types of nerve fibers:
        i) Afferent fibers: Transmit impulses from tissues/organs to CNS
        ii) Efferent fibers: Transmit regulatory impulses from CNS to tissues/organs

2. Further division of PNS:
   a) Somatic Neural System
      - Relays impulses from CNS to skeletal muscles
   b) Autonomic Neural System
      - Transmits impulses from CNS to involuntary organs and smooth muscles
      - Two subdivisions:
        i) Sympathetic Neural System
        ii) Parasympathetic Neural System

3. Visceral Nervous System:
   - Part of PNS
   - Complex of nerves, fibers, ganglia, and plexuses
   - Transmits impulses between CNS and viscera (internal organs)

18.3 Neuron as Structural and Functional Unit of Neural System

1. Structure of a neuron:
   a) Cell body: Contains cytoplasm, cell organelles, and Nissl's granules
   b) Dendrites: Short, branched fibers projecting from cell body; contain Nissl's granules; transmit impulses towards cell body
   c) Axon: Long fiber; distal end is branched; transmits impulses away from cell body

2. Synaptic knob:
   - Bulb-like structure at axon terminals
   - Contains synaptic vesicles with neurotransmitters

3. Types of neurons (based on axon and dendrite number):
   a) Multipolar: One axon, two or more dendrites (found in cerebral cortex)
   b) Bipolar: One axon, one dendrite (found in retina of eye)
   c) Unipolar: Cell body with one axon only (usually in embryonic stage)

4. Types of axons:
   a) Myelinated: Enveloped with Schwann cells forming myelin sheath
      - Gaps between myelin sheaths: Nodes of Ranvier
      - Found in spinal and cranial nerves
   b) Unmyelinated: Enclosed by Schwann cell without myelin sheath
      - Found in autonomous and somatic neural systems

18.3.1 Generation and Conduction of Nerve Impulse

1. Resting potential:
   - Neuron membrane is polarized
   - More permeable to K⁺ ions, less to Na⁺ ions
   - Axoplasm: High K⁺, low Na⁺, negatively charged proteins
   - Outside axon: Low K⁺, high Na⁺
   - Sodium-potassium pump: Maintains ionic gradient (3 Na⁺ out, 2 K⁺ in)
   - Result: Outer surface positive, inner surface negative

2. Action potential (nerve impulse):
   - Stimulus applied to polarized membrane
   - Na⁺ channels open, Na⁺ rushes in
   - Polarity reverses (depolarization)
   - Spreads to adjacent areas of axon membrane

3. Impulse conduction:
   - Action potential generated at one point triggers adjacent areas
   - K⁺ channels open briefly after Na⁺ channels close
   - K⁺ diffuses out, restoring resting potential (repolarization)

18.3.2 Transmission of Impulses

1. Synapse: Junction between neurons
   Types:
   a) Electrical synapse:
      - Membranes of pre- and post-synaptic neurons very close
      - Faster transmission
      - Rare in human nervous system
   b) Chemical synapse:
      - Synaptic cleft separates pre- and post-synaptic membranes
      - Uses neurotransmitters for transmission

2. Process of chemical synaptic transmission:
   - Action potential reaches axon terminal
   - Synaptic vesicles move towards membrane
   - Vesicles fuse with membrane, release neurotransmitters into synaptic cleft
   - Neurotransmitters bind to receptors on post-synaptic membrane
   - Ion channels open
   - New potential generated in post-synaptic neuron (excitatory or inhibitory)
