Here are comprehensive notes for topics 1.4 to 1.6, tailored for NEET preparation:

1.4 Uncertainty in Measurement

1.4.1 Scientific Notation
- Used for very large or very small numbers
- Format: N × 10ⁿ, where 1 ≤ N < 10 and n is an integer
- Examples:
  0.0048 = 4.8 × 10⁻³
  234,000 = 2.34 × 10⁵

Rules for mathematical operations:
a) Multiplication and Division:
   (5.6 × 10⁸) × (6.9 × 10⁵) = (5.6 × 6.9) × 10⁸⁺⁵ = 38.64 × 10¹³ = 3.864 × 10¹⁴
   (5.6 × 10⁴) ÷ (2.8 × 10⁻²) = (5.6 ÷ 2.8) × 10⁴⁺² = 2 × 10⁶

b) Addition and Subtraction:
   (6.65 × 10⁴) + (8.95 × 10³) = (6.65 × 10⁴) + (0.895 × 10⁴) = 7.545 × 10⁴
   (2.5 × 10⁻²) - (4.8 × 10⁻³) = (2.5 × 10⁻²) - (0.48 × 10⁻²) = 2.02 × 10⁻²

1.4.2 Significant Figures
- Definition: All certain digits plus one uncertain digit in a measurement
- Rules for determining significant figures:
  1. All non-zero digits are significant
  2. Zeros between non-zero digits are significant
  3. Leading zeros are not significant
  4. Trailing zeros in a number with a decimal point are significant
  5. Trailing zeros in a whole number may or may not be significant

- Rounding off:
  1. If the digit to be removed is > 5, the preceding digit is increased by 1
  2. If the digit to be removed is < 5, the preceding digit remains unchanged
  3. If the digit to be removed is 5, the preceding digit is increased by 1 if it's odd, and remains unchanged if it's even

- Significant figures in mathematical operations:
  a) Addition and subtraction: Result should have the same number of decimal places as the measurement with the least decimal places
  b) Multiplication and division: Result should have the same number of significant figures as the measurement with the least significant figures

1.5 Laws of Chemical Combinations

1.5.1 Law of Conservation of Mass (Lavoisier's Law)
Statement: Mass can neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction
Example: In the reaction 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O, the total mass of reactants equals the total mass of products

1.5.2 Law of Definite Proportions (Proust's Law)
Statement: A pure compound always contains the same elements combined in a fixed ratio by mass
Example: Water always contains hydrogen and oxygen in the ratio of 1:8 by mass

1.5.3 Law of Multiple Proportions (Dalton's Law)
Statement: When two elements form more than one compound, the masses of one element that combine with a fixed mass of the other element are in simple whole number ratios
Example: Carbon forms two oxides - CO and CO₂. The ratio of oxygen in these compounds (for a fixed amount of carbon) is 1:2

1.5.4 Gay Lussac's Law of Gaseous Volumes
Statement: When gases react, they do so in simple whole number ratios by volume (at constant temperature and pressure)
Example: 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O (2 volumes of H₂ react with 1 volume of O₂ to form 2 volumes of H₂O vapor)

1.5.5 Avogadro's Law
Statement: Equal volumes of all gases under the same conditions of temperature and pressure contain an equal number of molecules
Application: This law helps in understanding the relationship between moles and volumes of gases

1.6 Dalton's Atomic Theory

Key postulates:
1. Matter is made up of indivisible particles called atoms
2. Atoms of the same element are identical in mass and properties
3. Atoms of different elements have different masses and properties
4. Atoms combine in simple whole number ratios to form compounds
5. Chemical reactions involve reorganization of atoms; atoms are neither created nor destroyed

Limitations:
- Could not explain the existence of isotopes

- Mole: SI unit for amount of substance
- 1 mole = 6.022 × 10²³ entities (Avogadro's number)
- Molar mass: Mass of 1 mole of a substance in grams
- Molar mass (g/mol) is numerically equal to atomic/molecular/formula mass (u)

Relationships:
1. Number of moles (n) = Given mass / Molar mass
2. Number of moles (n) = Number of particles / Avogadro's number
3. Number of moles (n) = Volume of gas at STP / 22.4 L (molar volume of gas at STP)

Steps to determine empirical formula:
1. Convert mass % to mass (assuming 100g of compound)
2. Convert masses to moles
3. Divide moles by the smallest number of moles
4. Convert to whole number ratio

Steps to determine molecular formula:
1. Find empirical formula
2. Calculate empirical formula mass
3. Divide molar mass by empirical formula mass to get 'n'

1.10.2 Reactions in Solutions

Concentration units:
1. Mass percent (w/w %) = (Mass of solute / Mass of solution) × 100
2. Volume percent (v/v %) = (Volume of solute / Volume of solution) × 100
3. Mass by volume percent (w/v %) = (Mass of solute / Volume of solution in mL) × 100
4. Parts per million (ppm) = (Mass of solute / Mass of solution) × 10⁶
5. Mole fraction (x) = Number of moles of component / Total number of moles of all components
6. Molarity (M) = Moles of solute / Volume of solution in liters
7. Molality (m) = Moles of solute / Mass of solvent in kg

Important relationships:
- M₁V₁ = M₂V₂ (for dilution calculations)
- Normality (N) = (Molarity × Number of H⁺ or OH⁻ ions) or (Molarity × Oxidation number)
