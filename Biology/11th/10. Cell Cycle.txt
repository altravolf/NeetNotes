Here are detailed notes on topics 10.1 to 10.2 for NEET preparation, including all terms, explanations, and examples from the NCERT text:

10.1 Cell Cycle

Definition: The sequence of events by which a cell duplicates its genome, synthesizes other cell constituents, and eventually divides into two daughter cells.

Key Points:
- All organisms start life from a single cell
- Growth and reproduction are characteristics of cells
- Cells reproduce by dividing into two daughter cells

10.1.1 Phases of Cell Cycle

The cell cycle is divided into two basic phases:
1. Interphase (95% of cell cycle duration)
2. M Phase (Mitosis phase) (about 1 hour in a 24-hour human cell cycle)

Interphase: The phase between two successive M phases
Subdivided into:
a) G1 phase (Gap 1): 
   - Interval between mitosis and DNA replication
   - Cell is metabolically active and grows
   - No DNA replication occurs

b) S phase (Synthesis):
   - DNA replication takes place
   - DNA amount doubles (2C to 4C)
   - Chromosome number remains same (2n)
   - In animal cells, centriole duplication occurs in cytoplasm

c) G2 phase (Gap 2):
   - Protein synthesis for mitosis
   - Cell growth continues

G0 phase (Quiescent stage):
- Inactive stage entered by cells that don't divide further
- Cells remain metabolically active but don't proliferate

Examples:
- Human cells in culture divide once in approximately 24 hours
- Yeast cells progress through the cell cycle in about 90 minutes

Note: Plants show mitotic divisions in both haploid and diploid cells, while animals typically only show mitosis in diploid somatic cells (exception: male honey bees)

10.2 M Phase

Definition: The phase when actual cell division or mitosis occurs

Subdivided into:
1. Karyokinesis (nuclear division)
2. Cytokinesis (cytoplasmic division)

Karyokinesis involves four stages:

10.2.1 Prophase
- Chromosomal material condenses
- Chromosomes become visible, composed of two chromatids attached at the centromere
- Centrosome duplication and movement towards opposite poles
- Formation of asters (microtubules radiating from centrosomes)
- Golgi complex, endoplasmic reticulum, nucleolus, and nuclear envelope disappear

10.2.2 Metaphase
- Nuclear envelope completely disintegrates
- Chromosomes align at the equator (metaphase plate)
- Kinetochores (disc-shaped structures on centromeres) attach to spindle fibers
- Sister chromatids connect to opposite poles

10.2.3 Anaphase
- Centromeres split
- Sister chromatids (now called daughter chromosomes) migrate to opposite poles
- Centromeres lead, chromosome arms trail behind

10.2.4 Telophase
- Chromosomes decondense at poles
- Nuclear envelope reforms around chromosome clusters
- Nucleolus, Golgi complex, and ER reform

10.2.5 Cytokinesis
- Division of cytoplasm
- In animal cells: furrow appears in plasma membrane, deepens, and joins in center
- In plant cells: cell-plate forms in center and grows outward
- Organelles like mitochondria and plastids get distributed between daughter cells

Example of no cytokinesis: Syncytium formation (e.g., liquid endosperm in coconut)

Terms to remember:
- Equational division: Another name for mitosis (chromosome number remains same)
- Chromatids: Replicated chromosomes joined at centromere
- Asters: Microtubules radiating from centrosomes
- Kinetochores: Attachment sites for spindle fibers on centromeres
- Metaphase plate: Plane of chromosome alignment during metaphase
- Cell-plate: Precursor of new cell wall in plant cells during cytokinesis
- Syncytium: Multinucleate condition arising from karyokinesis without cytokinesis

Here are detailed notes on topics 10.3 to 10.5 for NEET preparation, including all terms, explanations, and examples from the NCERT text:

10.3 Significance of Mitosis

Key Points:
1. Equational division: Usually restricted to diploid cells (some exceptions in lower plants and social insects)
2. Produces genetically identical daughter cells
3. Responsible for growth in multicellular organisms
4. Helps maintain nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio
5. Essential for cell repair and replacement
6. Enables continuous growth in plants through meristematic tissues

Examples:
- Continuous replacement of upper layer of epidermis, gut lining cells, and blood cells
- Growth in plants through apical and lateral meristems

Terms:
- Meristematic tissues: Plant tissues with actively dividing cells

10.4 Meiosis

Definition: A specialized type of cell division that reduces the chromosome number by half, resulting in the production of haploid daughter cells.

Key Features:
1. Two sequential cycles of nuclear and cell division (Meiosis I and II)
2. Only one cycle of DNA replication
3. Pairing of homologous chromosomes and recombination
4. Formation of four haploid cells

10.4.1 Meiosis I

Prophase I:
Subdivided into five phases:
a) Leptotene: Chromosomes become visible and compact
b) Zygotene: Synapsis (pairing of homologous chromosomes) occurs
c) Pachytene: 
   - Tetrads (four chromatids) become visible
   - Crossing over occurs at recombination nodules
d) Diplotene: 
   - Synaptonemal complex dissolves
   - Chiasmata (X-shaped structures) appear
e) Diakinesis: 
   - Terminalisation of chiasmata
   - Chromosomes fully condensed
   - Nuclear envelope and nucleolus disappear

Metaphase I:
- Bivalents align on the equatorial plate
- Microtubules attach to kinetochores of homologous chromosomes

Anaphase I:
- Homologous chromosomes separate
- Sister chromatids remain attached at centromeres

Telophase I:
- Nuclear membrane and nucleolus reappear
- Cytokinesis follows, resulting in a dyad of cells

Interkinesis: Short stage between Meiosis I and II (no DNA replication)

10.4.2 Meiosis II

Prophase II: Similar to mitotic prophase, but shorter

Metaphase II:
- Chromosomes align at the equator
- Microtubules attach to kinetochores of sister chromatids

Anaphase II:
- Centromeres split
- Sister chromatids move to opposite poles

Telophase II:
- Nuclear envelope reforms around chromosome groups
- Cytokinesis results in a tetrad of haploid cells

10.5 Significance of Meiosis

1. Maintains chromosome number across generations in sexually reproducing organisms
2. Increases genetic variability through:
   a) Random segregation of paternal and maternal chromosomes
   b) Crossing over and recombination
3. Crucial for evolution by generating variations

Terms to remember:
- Synapsis: Pairing of homologous chromosomes
- Bivalent: Paired homologous chromosomes
- Tetrad: Four chromatids in a bivalent
- Crossing over: Exchange of genetic material between non-sister chromatids
- Chiasmata: X-shaped structures representing crossover points
- Recombination: Formation of new combinations of alleles
- Synaptonemal complex: Protein structure formed during synapsis
- Terminalisation: Movement of chiasmata towards chromosome ends
- Dyad: Two-cell stage after Meiosis I
- Tetrad: Four-cell stage after Meiosis II

Examples:
- Oocytes of some vertebrates can remain in diplotene stage for months or years
- Meiosis occurs during gametogenesis in plants and animals

Note: The significance of meiosis in evolution is emphasized, as it generates genetic variability essential for the process of evolution.
