   - Each breast divided into 15-20 mammary lobes
   - Mammary lobes contain alveoli clusters
   - Alveoli: Secrete milk
   - Milk storage: Alveoli lumen → Mammary tubules → Mammary duct → Mammary ampulla → Lactiferous duct

Key terms to remember:

Remember to review and understand the functions of each component in both male and female reproductive systems for NEET preparation.






# ******************************* Part 2 ******************************

Here are detailed notes on topics 2.3 to 2.7 for NEET preparation, covering all terms, explanations, and examples from the NCERT text:

2.3 Gametogenesis

1. Spermatogenesis:
   - Definition: Process of sperm formation in males
   - Begins at puberty
   - Location: Seminiferous tubules of testes
   - Steps:
     a) Spermatogonia (diploid, 46 chromosomes) multiply by mitosis
     b) Primary spermatocytes undergo meiosis I → two haploid secondary spermatocytes (23 chromosomes each)
     c) Secondary spermatocytes undergo meiosis II → four haploid spermatids
     d) Spermiogenesis: Transformation of spermatids into spermatozoa (sperm)
     e) Spermiation: Release of sperms from Sertoli cells into seminiferous tubules

   - Hormonal regulation:
     a) GnRH (Gonadotropin-releasing hormone) from hypothalamus
     b) FSH (Follicle-stimulating hormone) and LH (Luteinizing hormone) from anterior pituitary
     c) Testosterone (androgen) from Leydig cells

2. Structure of Sperm:
   - Head: Contains haploid nucleus and acrosome (enzymes for fertilization)
   - Neck
   - Middle piece: Contains mitochondria for energy
   - Tail: For motility

3. Oogenesis:
   - Definition: Process of ovum formation in females
   - Begins during embryonic development
   - Steps:
     a) Oogonia form in fetal ovary
     b) Primary oocytes formed and arrested in prophase I of meiosis
     c) At puberty, primary oocyte completes meiosis I → large secondary oocyte + small first polar body
     d) Secondary oocyte begins meiosis II but stops at metaphase II
     e) Meiosis II completed only if fertilization occurs → mature ovum + second polar body

4. Follicular Development:
   - Primary follicle: Primary oocyte surrounded by layer of granulosa cells
   - Secondary follicle: More layers of granulosa cells and theca layer
   - Tertiary follicle: Fluid-filled cavity (antrum) forms
   - Graafian follicle: Mature follicle ready for ovulation

2.4 Menstrual Cycle

- Definition: Reproductive cycle in female primates
- Duration: Average 28/29 days
- Phases:
  1. Menstrual phase (1-5 days): Shedding of endometrium
  2. Follicular phase (6-13 days): Follicle development and endometrium regeneration
  3. Ovulatory phase (14th day): Release of ovum
  4. Luteal phase (15-28 days): Corpus luteum formation and maintenance of endometrium

- Hormonal regulation:
  - FSH and LH from anterior pituitary
  - Estrogen and progesterone from ovaries

- Key events:
  - Menarche: First menstruation at puberty
  - Menopause: Cessation of menstruation (around 50 years of age)

2.5 Fertilisation and Implantation

1. Fertilisation:
   - Definition: Fusion of sperm and ovum
   - Location: Ampullary region of fallopian tube
   - Process:
     a) Sperm penetrates zona pellucida of ovum
     b) Cortical reaction prevents polyspermy
     c) Sperm nucleus fuses with ovum nucleus → Zygote (diploid, 46 chromosomes)

2. Sex Determination:
   - Male determines the sex of baby
   - XX zygote → Female baby
   - XY zygote → Male baby

3. Cleavage and Blastocyst Formation:
   - Zygote undergoes mitotic divisions (cleavage) → Morula (16 cells) → Blastocyst
   - Blastocyst structure:
     a) Trophoblast: Outer layer
     b) Inner cell mass: Embryo proper

4. Implantation:
   - Definition: Attachment of blastocyst to endometrium
   - Occurs 7 days after fertilization

2.6 Pregnancy and Embryonic Development

1. Placenta Formation:
   - Chorionic villi of embryo interdigitate with uterine tissue
   - Functions: Nutrient and gas exchange, hormone production

2. Pregnancy Duration: 9 months (gestation period)

3. Embryonic Development Milestones:
   - 1 month: Heart formation
   - 2 months: Limbs and digits develop
   - 3 months (end of first trimester): Major organ systems formed
   - 5 months: First movements and hair on head
   - 6 months (end of second trimester): Body covered with fine hair, eyelids separate

4. Pregnancy Hormones:
   - hCG (human Chorionic Gonadotropin)
   - hPL (human Placental Lactogen)
   - Estrogens, Progestogens
   - Relaxin (from ovary)

2.7 Parturition and Lactation

1. Parturition:
   - Definition: Process of childbirth
   - Induced by:
     a) Foetal ejection reflex
     b) Oxytocin from maternal pituitary
   - Positive feedback mechanism between uterine contractions and oxytocin release

2. Lactation:
   - Definition: Production of milk by mammary glands
   - Colostrum: First milk produced, rich in antibodies
   - Importance: Essential for newborn's immunity

Key terms to remember:
- Spermiogenesis: Transformation of spermatids into spermatozoa
- Spermiation: Release of sperms from seminiferous tubules
- Polar body: Small cell produced during oogenesis with no further function
- Graafian follicle: Mature ovarian follicle
- Corpus luteum: Structure formed from ruptured follicle after ovulation
- Morula: Early stage embryo with 16 cells
- Blastocyst: Hollow ball of cells formed before implantation
- Implantation: Attachment of embryo to uterine wall
- Gestation: Period of embryo/fetus development in the uterus
- Parturition: Process of childbirth
- Colostrum: First milk produced after childbirth, rich in antibodies

Remember to understand the hormonal regulation of these processes and their timing for NEET preparation.
