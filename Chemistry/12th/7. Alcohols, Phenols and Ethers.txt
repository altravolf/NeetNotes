Here are detailed notes for the Introduction and sections 7.1 to 7.3, tailored for NEET preparation:

Introduction to Alcohols, Phenols, and Ethers

- Alcohols, phenols, and ethers are important organic compounds with various applications
- They are formed by replacing hydrogen atoms in hydrocarbons with -OH groups or -O- groups
- Examples of everyday uses:
  * Ethanol in furniture polish
  * Sugar, cotton, and paper contain compounds with -OH groups
  * Phenols in antiseptics
  * Ethers in fragrances

Key Definitions:
- Alcohol: Compound with one or more -OH groups attached to alkyl (saturated hydrocarbon) groups
- Phenol: Compound with -OH group(s) attached to aromatic rings
- Ether: Compound with an oxygen atom bonded to two alkyl or aryl groups

7.1 Classification

7.1.1 Alcohols
A. Based on number of -OH groups:
   1. Monohydric: One -OH group (e.g., CH₃OH, methanol)
   2. Dihydric: Two -OH groups (e.g., HOCH₂CH₂OH, ethylene glycol)
   3. Trihydric: Three -OH groups (e.g., HOCH₂CH(OH)CH₂OH, glycerol)
   4. Polyhydric: More than three -OH groups

B. Based on the carbon atom to which -OH is attached:
   1. Primary (1°): -OH attached to a carbon with one alkyl group
      R-CH₂-OH (R is an alkyl group)
   2. Secondary (2°): -OH attached to a carbon with two alkyl groups
      R₂CH-OH
   3. Tertiary (3°): -OH attached to a carbon with three alkyl groups
      R₃C-OH

C. Special types:
   1. Allylic alcohols: -OH group on carbon adjacent to C=C double bond
      CH₂=CH-CH₂-OH (allyl alcohol)
   2. Benzylic alcohols: -OH group on carbon adjacent to benzene ring
      C₆H₅-CH₂-OH (benzyl alcohol)

7.1.2 Phenols
A. Based on number of -OH groups:
   1. Monohydric: One -OH group (e.g., C₆H₅OH, phenol)
   2. Dihydric: Two -OH groups (e.g., catechol, resorcinol, hydroquinone)
   3. Trihydric: Three -OH groups (e.g., pyrogallol, phloroglucinol)

7.1.3 Ethers
A. Based on alkyl/aryl groups attached to oxygen:
   1. Symmetrical (simple): Same groups on both sides of oxygen
      R-O-R (e.g., CH₃-O-CH₃, dimethyl ether)
   2. Unsymmetrical (mixed): Different groups on each side of oxygen
      R-O-R' (e.g., CH₃-O-C₂H₅, methyl ethyl ether)

7.2 Nomenclature

7.2.1 Alcohols
A. Common system:
   - Name derived from the alkyl group + "alcohol"
   - Example: CH₃OH is methyl alcohol

B. IUPAC system:
   - Replace "-e" in alkane name with "-ol"
   - Numbering starts from the end closest to -OH group
   - For polyhydric alcohols, use prefixes di-, tri-, etc.
   - Examples:
     * CH₃-CH₂-OH: Ethanol
     * CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₃: Propan-2-ol
     * HO-CH₂-CH₂-OH: Ethane-1,2-diol

7.2.2 Phenols
A. Simple phenol:
   - Both common and IUPAC name is "phenol" (C₆H₅OH)

B. Substituted phenols:
   - Use prefixes ortho- (1,2-), meta- (1,3-), and para- (1,4-) for disubstituted benzene rings
   - Examples:
     * 2-methylphenol (o-cresol)
     * 3-methylphenol (m-cresol)
     * 4-methylphenol (p-cresol)
     * Benzene-1,2-diol (catechol)
     * Benzene-1,3-diol (resorcinol)
     * Benzene-1,4-diol (hydroquinone)

7.2.3 Ethers
A. Common system:
   - Names of alkyl/aryl groups in alphabetical order + "ether"
   - Example: CH₃-O-C₂H₅ is ethyl methyl ether

B. IUPAC system:
   - Larger group as parent chain, smaller group as alkoxy substituent
   - Examples:
     * CH₃-O-CH₃: Methoxymethane
     * C₆H₅-O-CH₃: Methoxybenzene (anisole)
     * C₆H₅-O-CH₂CH₃: Ethoxybenzene (phenetole)

7.3 Structures of Functional Groups

7.3.1 Alcohols
- C-O-H bond angle slightly less than tetrahedral (109°28')
- sp³ hybridized carbon and oxygen
- Two lone pairs on oxygen cause slight repulsion

7.3.2 Phenols
- C-O bond length (136 pm) slightly shorter than in alcohols
- Partial double bond character due to resonance with aromatic ring
- sp² hybridized carbon attached to -OH group

7.3.3 Ethers
- C-O-C bond angle slightly larger than tetrahedral
- Four electron pairs (two bond pairs, two lone pairs) on oxygen
- C-O bond length (141 pm) similar to alcohols

These notes cover the introductory material and sections 7.1 to 7.3 of the chapter, including all important terms, definitions, classifications, and structural information relevant for NEET preparation.
