Introduction to d-block and f-block Elements (for NEET)

Key Points:
- d-block: Groups 3-12 in the periodic table
- f-block: Lanthanoids and Actinoids
- d-block elements: Also called transition elements
- f-block elements: Also called inner transition elements

Characteristics:
1. Partially filled d or f orbitals
2. Metallic properties
3. Variable oxidation states
4. Colored compounds
5. Catalytic properties
6. Complex formation

4.1 Position in the Periodic Table

d-block:
- Located between s-block and p-block
- Consists of 4 series:
  1. 3d series (Sc to Zn)
  2. 4d series (Y to Cd)
  3. 5d series (La and Hf to Hg)
  4. 6d series (Ac and Rf to Cn)

f-block:
- Placed at the bottom of the periodic table
- Two series:
  1. Lanthanoids (Ce to Lu)
  2. Actinoids (Th to Lr)

4.2 Electronic Configurations of the d-Block Elements

General configuration: (n-1)d¹⁻¹⁰ns¹⁻²

Exceptions:
- Cr: [Ar]3d⁵4s¹ (instead of 3d⁴4s²)
- Cu: [Ar]3d¹⁰4s¹ (instead of 3d⁹4s²)
- Pd: [Kr]4d¹⁰5s⁰

Reason for exceptions:
- Half-filled and completely filled d-orbitals are more stable
- Small energy difference between (n-1)d and ns orbitals

Important terms:
1. Valence electrons: Electrons in the outermost shell
2. Ground state: Lowest energy state of an atom
3. Excited state: Higher energy state of an atom

Electronic configurations of some important d-block elements:

Sc (21): [Ar]3d¹4s²
Ti (22): [Ar]3d²4s²
V (23): [Ar]3d³4s²
Cr (24): [Ar]3d⁵4s¹
Mn (25): [Ar]3d⁵4s²
Fe (26): [Ar]3d⁶4s²
Co (27): [Ar]3d⁷4s²
Ni (28): [Ar]3d⁸4s²
Cu (29): [Ar]3d¹⁰4s¹
Zn (30): [Ar]3d¹⁰4s²

Note: 
- [Ar] represents the electronic configuration of Argon: 1s²2s²2p⁶3s²3p⁶
- For elements after the 3d series, replace [Ar] with [Kr] or [Xe] as appropriate

Formulas to remember:
1. Number of valence electrons = Group number (for d-block elements)
2. Maximum oxidation state = Number of unpaired electrons in ground state + ns electrons

Practice:
- Write electronic configurations for ions (e.g., Fe²⁺, Cu²⁺)
- Identify exceptions to the general trend
- Determine the number of unpaired electrons in ground state

4.3 General Properties of the Transition Elements (d-Block)

4.3.1 Physical Properties

1. Metallic character:
   - High tensile strength
   - Ductility (ability to be drawn into wires)
   - Malleability (ability to be hammered into sheets)
   - High thermal and electrical conductivity

2. High melting and boiling points:
   - Due to strong interatomic bonding
   - Involvement of (n-1)d electrons in bonding

3. Density:
   - Generally high and increases across the period

4.3.2 Variation in Atomic and Ionic Sizes

- Atomic and ionic radii decrease across the period
- Reason: Poor shielding effect of d-electrons

Lanthanoid contraction:
- Decrease in size from La to Lu
- Affects the size of elements in 5d and 6d series

4.3.3 Ionisation Enthalpies

- Generally increase across the period
- Irregular trend due to extra stability of half-filled (d⁵) and completely filled (d¹⁰) configurations

4.3.4 Oxidation States

- Variable oxidation states due to involvement of (n-1)d and ns electrons
- Common oxidation states: +2 and +3
- Highest oxidation state: Group number (up to Mn)

Examples:
Sc: +3
Ti: +2, +3, +4
V: +2, +3, +4, +5
Cr: +2, +3, +6
Mn: +2, +3, +4, +6, +7
Fe: +2, +3
Co: +2, +3
Ni: +2, +3
Cu: +1, +2
Zn: +2

4.3.5 Trends in the M²⁺/M Standard Electrode Potentials

- Generally become less negative across the period
- Exceptions: Mn, Zn (more negative than expected)

4.3.6 Trends in the M³⁺/M²⁺ Standard Electrode Potentials

- Irregular trend
- Influenced by factors like ionization energy, sublimation enthalpy, and hydration enthalpy

4.3.7 Trends in Stability of Higher Oxidation States

- Higher oxidation states more stable for early transition elements
- Stability decreases across the period

4.3.8 Chemical Reactivity and E° Values

- Reactivity generally decreases across the period
- E° values become less negative (more positive) across the period

4.3.9 Magnetic Properties

- Paramagnetism due to unpaired electrons
- Magnetic moment (μ) calculation:
  μ = √[n(n+2)] BM
  where n = number of unpaired electrons, BM = Bohr magneton

4.3.10 Formation of Colored Ions

- Due to d-d transitions
- Color depends on the number of d-electrons

4.3.11 Formation of Complex Compounds

- Ability to form coordination compounds
- Due to small size, high charge, and availability of vacant d-orbitals

4.3.12 Catalytic Properties

- Act as catalysts in many reactions
- Due to variable oxidation states and ability to form intermediate compounds

4.3.13 Formation of Interstitial Compounds

- Formed with small non-metal atoms (H, C, N)
- Example: TiC, Fe₃H

4.3.14 Alloy Formation

- Ability to form alloys with other metals
- Examples: Steel (Fe + C), Brass (Cu + Zn)

Important formulas:

1. Effective atomic number (EAN) = Atomic number - Number of electrons lost
2. Crystal Field Stabilization Energy (CFSE) calculation (for octahedral complexes):
   CFSE = -0.4Δo (for d¹, d², d³, d⁴, d⁵)
   CFSE = -0.6Δo (for d⁶, d⁷, d⁸, d⁹)
   where Δo = crystal field splitting energy

Remember to practice:
- Writing electronic configurations for different oxidation states
- Calculating magnetic moments
- Predicting colors of transition metal ions
- Balancing redox reactions involving transition metals
