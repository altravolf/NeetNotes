# ******************************* Part 1 ******************************

Here are detailed notes on sections 4.1 and 4.2 for NEET preparation, including all terms, explanations, and examples from NCERT:

4.1 Mendel's Laws of Inheritance

- Gregor Mendel conducted hybridization experiments on garden peas (1856-1863)
- First to apply statistical analysis and mathematical logic to biology
- Studied characters with two opposing traits (e.g., tall vs. dwarf plants)
- Used 14 true-breeding pea plant varieties
- True-breeding: Shows stable trait inheritance over several generations of self-pollination

Key experiments:
- Studied 7 pairs of contrasting traits in pea plants:
  1. Stem height: Tall vs. Dwarf
  2. Flower color: Violet vs. White
  3. Flower position: Axial vs. Terminal
  4. Pod shape: Inflated vs. Constricted
  5. Pod color: Green vs. Yellow
  6. Seed shape: Round vs. Wrinkled
  7. Seed color: Yellow vs. Green

4.2 Inheritance of One Gene

Example: Tall vs. Dwarf pea plants

Procedure:
1. Cross tall and dwarf pea plants
2. Collect seeds and grow F1 generation
3. Self-pollinate F1 plants to produce F2 generation

Results:
- All F1 plants were tall
- F2 generation: 3/4 tall, 1/4 dwarf

Key concepts:
- Dominant trait: Expressed in F1 generation (e.g., tall)
- Recessive trait: Not expressed in F1, reappears in F2 (e.g., dwarf)
- Alleles: Alternative forms of a gene (e.g., T for tall, t for dwarf)
- Genotype: Genetic makeup (e.g., TT, Tt, tt)
- Phenotype: Physical expression of genes (e.g., tall or dwarf)
- Homozygous: Two identical alleles (e.g., TT or tt)
- Heterozygous: Two different alleles (e.g., Tt)

4.2.1 Law of Dominance

States that:
1. Characters are controlled by discrete units called factors (genes)
2. Factors occur in pairs
3. In a dissimilar pair of factors, one is dominant over the other (recessive)

Explains:
- Expression of only one parental character in F1
- Reappearance of both characters in F2
- 3:1 ratio in F2 generation

4.2.2 Law of Segregation

States that:
- Alleles separate during gamete formation
- Each gamete receives only one allele of a pair

Punnett Square: Graphical representation of possible genotypes in offspring

Example: TT (tall) x tt (dwarf) cross
- Gametes: All T from tall parent, all t from dwarf parent
- F1 generation: All Tt (heterozygous tall)
- F1 gametes: 50% T, 50% t
- F2 generation: 1 TT : 2 Tt : 1 tt (genotypic ratio 1:2:1)
- F2 phenotypic ratio: 3 tall : 1 dwarf (3:1)

4.2.2.1 Incomplete Dominance

Definition: Neither allele is completely dominant; heterozygous phenotype is intermediate

Example: Flower color in snapdragon (Antirrhinum sp.)
- RR: Red flowers
- rr: White flowers
- Rr: Pink flowers (intermediate phenotype)

F2 ratio: 1 Red : 2 Pink : 1 White (1:2:1 phenotypic and genotypic ratio)

4.2.2.2 Co-dominance

Definition: Both alleles express themselves in the heterozygous condition

Example: ABO blood groups in humans
- Controlled by gene I with three alleles: IA, IB, and i
- IA and IB are co-dominant, both dominant to i
- Six possible genotypes: IAIA, IAIB, IAi, IBIB, IBi, ii
- Four phenotypes: A, B, AB, O

Multiple alleles: More than two alleles for a single gene in a population

These notes cover the main concepts, terms, and examples from sections 4.1 and 4.2 of the NCERT text, providing a comprehensive overview for NEET preparation.











# ****************************** Part 2 ******************************

Here are detailed notes on sections 4.3 to 4.6 for NEET preparation, including all terms, explanations, and examples from NCERT:

4.3 Inheritance of Two Genes

Example: Round, yellow seeds (RRYY) × Wrinkled, green seeds (rryy)

Key concepts:
- Dihybrid cross: Cross between plants differing in two pairs of contrasting traits
- F1 generation: All round, yellow seeds (RrYy)
- F2 generation: 9:3:3:1 ratio (9 round yellow : 3 round green : 3 wrinkled yellow : 1 wrinkled green)

4.3.1 Law of Independent Assortment

States that:
When two pairs of traits are combined in a hybrid, segregation of one pair of characters is independent of the other pair of characters.

Explanation:
- Genes for different traits segregate independently during gamete formation
- Results in the formation of all possible combinations of parental genes

4.3.2 Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance

Proposed by Walter Sutton and Theodore Boveri

Key points:
- Chromosomes occur in pairs
- Chromosomes segregate during gamete formation
- Independent pairs of chromosomes segregate independently
- Behaviour of chromosomes parallels the behaviour of genes

4.3.3 Linkage and Recombination

Discovered by Thomas Hunt Morgan (worked with Drosophila melanogaster)

Linkage:
- Physical association of genes on the same chromosome
- Linked genes do not show independent assortment

Recombination:
- Exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes during meiosis
- Leads to new combinations of alleles

4.4 Polygenic Inheritance

Definition: Traits controlled by three or more genes

Characteristics:
- Shows continuous variation
- Influenced by environment

Example: Human skin color
- Controlled by three genes A, B, C
- Dominant alleles (A, B, C) contribute to dark skin
- Recessive alleles (a, b, c) contribute to light skin
- Number of dominant alleles determines the degree of skin darkness

4.5 Pleiotropy

Definition: A single gene affecting multiple phenotypic traits

Example: Phenylketonuria in humans
- Caused by mutation in gene coding for phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme
- Affects multiple traits:
  1. Mental retardation
  2. Reduced hair pigmentation
  3. Reduced skin pigmentation

4.6 Sex Determination

4.6.1 Sex Determination in Humans

XY type:
- Females: XX (homogametic)
- Males: XY (heterogametic)
- Males produce two types of gametes: X and Y
- Females produce only one type of gamete: X

Inheritance:
- 50% chance of male or female offspring in each pregnancy
- Father's sperm determines the sex of the child

4.6.2 Sex Determination in Honey Bee

Haplodiploidy:
- Females (queens and workers): Diploid (32 chromosomes)
- Males (drones): Haploid (16 chromosomes)

Characteristics:
- Fertilized eggs develop into females
- Unfertilized eggs develop into males (parthenogenesis)
- Males produce sperm by mitosis
- Males have no father and cannot have sons
- Males have a grandfather and can have grandsons

Additional examples of sex determination:

1. XO type (e.g., grasshoppers):
   - Females: XX
   - Males: XO (only one X chromosome, no Y)

2. ZW type (e.g., birds):
   - Females: ZW (heterogametic)
   - Males: ZZ (homogametic)

These notes cover the main concepts, terms, and examples from sections 4.3 to 4.6 of the NCERT text, providing a comprehensive overview for NEET preparation.

Here are detailed notes on sections 4.7 and 4.8 for NEET preparation, including all terms, explanations, and examples from NCERT:

4.7 Mutation

Definition: Alteration in DNA sequences resulting in changes in genotype and phenotype

Types:
1. Chromosomal aberrations: Large-scale changes in chromosomes
   - Deletion: Loss of a chromosome segment
   - Duplication: Gain of a chromosome segment
   - Inversion: Reversal of a chromosome segment

2. Point mutation: Change in a single base pair of DNA
   Example: Sickle-cell anemia
   - Substitution of Glutamic acid (GAG) by Valine (GUG) in the beta-globin gene
   - Causes abnormal hemoglobin molecule (HbS)
   - RBCs become sickle-shaped under low oxygen tension

3. Frameshift mutation: Insertion or deletion of base pairs, altering the reading frame

Mutagens: Agents that induce mutations (e.g., UV radiation)

4.8 Genetic Disorders

4.8.1 Pedigree Analysis

Definition: Study of inheritance patterns of traits in families over generations

Uses:
- Trace inheritance of specific traits, abnormalities, or diseases
