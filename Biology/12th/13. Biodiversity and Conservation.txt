Here are comprehensive notes on the Introduction, 13.1, and 13.2 topics for NEET, including explanations of terms and examples from the NCERT text:

Introduction to Biodiversity

1. Biodiversity Definition: The enormous diversity of life on Earth, ranging from macromolecules within cells to biomes.

2. Levels of Biodiversity:
   - Genetic diversity
   - Species diversity
   - Ecological diversity

3. Significance: Critical for human survival and well-being on the planet.

13.1 BIODIVERSITY

1. Species Count:
   - Described species: Over 1.5 million
   - Estimated total species: 5-50 million (conservative estimate: 7 million)

2. Distribution of Species:
   - Animals: 70% of all recorded species
   - Plants: 22% of all recorded species
   - Insects: 70% of all animal species

3. India's Biodiversity:
   - 8.1% of global species diversity
   - Recorded: 45,000 plant species, 91,000 animal species
   - Estimated undiscovered: 1,00,000 plant species, 3,00,000 animal species

4. Patterns of Biodiversity:

   a) Latitudinal Gradients:
      - Species diversity generally decreases from equator to poles
      - Example: Colombia (1,400 bird species) vs. New York (105 bird species) vs. Greenland (56 bird species)
      - Hypotheses for tropical biodiversity:
        i) Longer evolutionary time
        ii) Constant environments promoting niche specialization
        iii) Higher productivity due to more solar energy

   b) Species-Area Relationships:
      - Described by the equation: log S = log C + Z log A
        (S = Species richness, A = Area, Z = slope, C = Y-intercept)
      - Z value typically between 0.1 to 0.2 for smaller areas
      - Z value between 0.6 to 1.2 for very large areas (e.g., continents)

5. Importance of Species Diversity:
   - Contributes to ecosystem stability and productivity
   - Essential for human survival
   - Rivet Popper Hypothesis: Compares species to rivets in an airplane, emphasizing the cumulative effect of species loss

6. Loss of Biodiversity:
   - Recent extinctions: 784 species in the last 500 years
   - Current extinction rate: 100 to 1,000 times faster than pre-human times
   - Vulnerable groups: 12% of birds, 23% of mammals, 32% of amphibians, 31% of gymnosperms

7. Causes of Biodiversity Loss (The Evil Quartet):
   a) Habitat loss and fragmentation
      - Example: Destruction of tropical rainforests
   b) Over-exploitation
      - Example: Overharvesting of marine fish populations
   c) Alien species invasions
      - Example: Nile perch in Lake Victoria, water hyacinth in India
   d) Co-extinctions
      - Example: Extinction of host-specific parasites when the host species becomes extinct

13.2 BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION

1. Reasons for Conservation:
   a) Narrowly utilitarian: Direct economic benefits (food, medicine, industrial products)
      - Example: 25% of drugs derived from plants
   b) Broadly utilitarian: Ecosystem services
      - Example: Amazon forest producing 20% of Earth's oxygen
   c) Ethical: Intrinsic value of species

2. Conservation Approaches:
   a) In situ conservation:
      - Protecting species in their natural habitats
      - Examples: Biosphere reserves, national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, sacred groves
      - India has 14 biosphere reserves, 90 national parks, 448 wildlife sanctuaries
      - Biodiversity hotspots: 34 globally, including Western Ghats-Sri Lanka, Himalaya, and Indo-Burma in India

   b) Ex situ conservation:
      - Protecting threatened species outside their natural habitats
      - Examples: Zoological parks, botanical gardens, seed banks
      - Techniques: Cryopreservation, in vitro fertilization, tissue culture

3. International Efforts:
   - Convention on Biological Diversity (1992)
   - World Summit on Sustainable Development (2002)

Key Terms:
- Biodiversity: The variety of life forms on Earth
- Species richness: The number of different species in a given area
- Endemism: Species confined to a particular region
- Biosphere reserves: Areas of terrestrial and coastal ecosystems promoting conservation and sustainable use
- Sacred groves: Protected forests due to religious and cultural traditions
- Cryopreservation: Preserving biological material at very low temperatures
