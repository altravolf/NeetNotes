I apologize for the oversight. You're right, I didn't fully apply the formatting to all instances. Let me correct that and provide the notes with consistent superscript and subscript formatting:

Introduction to Solutions
- A solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances.
- Components: Solute (dissolved substance) and Solvent (dissolving medium)
- Solutions can exist in all states of matter: solid, liquid, and gas

1.1 Types of Solutions
1. Gaseous Solutions
   - Gas in gas: Air (mixture of gases)
   - Liquid in gas: Water vapor in air
   - Solid in gas: Camphor in nitrogen
2. Liquid Solutions
   - Gas in liquid: Oxygen in water (aerated water)
   - Liquid in liquid: Ethanol in water
   - Solid in liquid: Sugar in water
3. Solid Solutions
   - Gas in solid: Hydrogen in palladium
   - Liquid in solid: Mercury in silver (amalgam)
   - Solid in solid: Copper in gold (alloy)

1.2 Expressing Concentration of Solutions
1. Mass Percentage (w/w):
   - Formula: Mass % of component = (Mass of component / Total mass of solution) × 100
2. Volume Percentage (v/v):
   - Formula: Volume % of component = (Volume of component / Total volume of solution) × 100
3. Mass by Volume Percentage (w/v):
   - Mass of solute dissolved in 100 mL of solution
4. Parts per Million (ppm):
   - Formula: ppm = (Number of parts of component / Total parts of all components) × 10⁶
5. Mole Fraction (x):
   - Formula: xₐ = nₐ / (nₐ + nᵦ)
   - Where nₐ and nᵦ are the number of moles of components A and B
6. Molarity (M):
   - Formula: M = Moles of solute / Volume of solution in liters
7. Molality (m):
   - Formula: m = Moles of solute / Mass of solvent in kg

1.3 Solubility
- Solubility: Maximum amount of solute that can dissolve in a given amount of solvent at a specific temperature and pressure

1.3.1 Solubility of a Solid in a Liquid
- Factors affecting solubility:
  1. Nature of solute and solvent
  2. Temperature
  3. Pressure (for gases)
- Saturation: When no more solute can dissolve at given conditions
- Unsaturated solution: Can dissolve more solute
- Supersaturated solution: Contains more dissolved solute than a saturated solution under normal conditions

1.3.2 Solubility of a Gas in a Liquid
- Henry's Law: At constant temperature, the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of the gas above the liquid
- Formula: p = Kₕ × x
  Where:
  p = partial pressure of the gas
  Kₕ = Henry's law constant
  x = mole fraction of the gas in solution
- Effect of temperature: Solubility of gases in liquids generally decreases with increasing temperature

Key Terms:
- Homogeneous: Uniform composition throughout
- Heterogeneous: Non-uniform composition
- Solute: The substance being dissolved
- Solvent: The dissolving medium
- Saturated solution: Contains maximum amount of dissolved solute
- Unsaturated solution: Can dissolve more solute
- Supersaturated solution: Contains more dissolved solute than a saturated solution under normal conditions
- Henry's law constant: Proportionality constant in Henry's law, specific to each gas-liquid pair

Remember to practice numerical problems related to concentration calculations and Henry's law for NEET preparation.

Here are the notes with proper subscript and superscript formatting:

1.7 Abnormal Molar Masses
- Abnormal molar mass: When experimentally determined molar mass differs from expected value due to association or dissociation of solute particles in solution

1. Dissociation:
   - Occurs in ionic compounds
   - Experimentally determined molar mass is lower than expected
   - Example: KCl dissociates into K⁺ and Cl⁻ ions in water

2. Association:
   - Occurs due to hydrogen bonding or other intermolecular forces
   - Experimentally determined molar mass is higher than expected
   - Example: Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) forms dimers in benzene

van 't Hoff Factor (i):
- Quantifies the extent of dissociation or association
- Formula: i = Normal molar mass / Abnormal molar mass
- Also defined as: i = Observed colligative property / Calculated colligative property
- i > 1 for dissociation
- i < 1 for association
- i = 1 for no dissociation or association

Modified equations for colligative properties:
1. Relative lowering of vapour pressure:
   (p°₁ - p₁) / p°₁ = i × n₂ / (n₁ + n₂)
2. Elevation of boiling point:
   ΔTᵦ = i × Kᵦ × m
3. Depression of freezing point:
   ΔTf = i × Kf × m
4. Osmotic pressure:
   π = i × CRT

Degree of Dissociation (α):
- For a solute that dissociates into n ions:
  i = 1 + α(n - 1)
- For a solute that associates to form dimers:
  i = 1 - α/2

Key Terms:
- Abnormal molar mass: Experimentally determined molar mass that differs from expected value
- Dissociation: Separation of a compound into ions in solution
- Association: Combining of molecules to form larger units in solution
- van 't Hoff factor (i): Ratio of actual number of particles in solution to the number of particles originally present
- Degree of dissociation (α): Fraction of total solute that dissociates

Important Points for NEET:
1. Understand the concept of abnormal molar mass and its causes (dissociation and association).
2. Memorize the van 't Hoff factor formula and its relationship to colligative properties.
3. Practice problems involving the calculation of van 't Hoff factor and degree of dissociation.
4. Know how to modify colligative property equations using the van 't Hoff factor.
5. Be familiar with examples of substances that show abnormal molar mass behavior in different solvents.

Remember to solve numerical problems related to abnormal molar masses and van 't Hoff factor for NEET preparation.
