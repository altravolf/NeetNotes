Here are comprehensive notes for the Introduction and sections 2.1 to 2.3, tailored for NEET preparation:

Introduction to Electrochemistry

- Electrochemistry: Study of interconversion of electrical and chemical energy
- Applications: Batteries, fuel cells, corrosion prevention, metal extraction and purification

2.1 Electrochemical Cells

- Electrochemical cell: Device converting chemical energy to electrical energy (or vice versa)
- Components: Two electrodes (anode and cathode) and electrolyte solution

2.1.1 Galvanic Cells
- Spontaneously converts chemical energy to electrical energy
- Example: Daniell cell
  - Anode: Zn electrode in ZnSO₄ solution
  - Cathode: Cu electrode in CuSO₄ solution
  - Salt bridge: Connects two half-cells, maintains electrical neutrality
- Reaction: Zn(s) + Cu²⁺(aq) → Zn²⁺(aq) + Cu(s)
- Cell notation: Zn(s)|Zn²⁺(aq)||Cu²⁺(aq)|Cu(s)

2.1.2 Electrolytic Cells
- Uses electrical energy to drive non-spontaneous chemical reactions
- Example: Electrolysis of molten NaCl
  - Cathode reaction: Na⁺ + e⁻ → Na
  - Anode reaction: 2Cl⁻ → Cl₂ + 2e⁻

2.1.3 Standard Electrode Potential (E°)
- Measure of tendency of an electrode to gain or lose electrons
- Measured with respect to Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE)
- SHE: Pt electrode in 1M H⁺ solution with 1 atm H₂ gas, assigned E° = 0.00 V
- More positive E°: Greater tendency to be reduced
- More negative E°: Greater tendency to be oxidized

2.2 Nernst Equation

- Relates cell potential to standard cell potential and concentration of reactants/products
- For a general reaction: aA + bB → cC + dD
- Nernst equation: E = E° - (RT/nF) ln([C]ᶜ[D]ᵈ/[A]ᵃ[B]ᵇ)
  Where:
  E = Cell potential
  E° = Standard cell potential
  R = Gas constant (8.314 J/K/mol)
  T = Temperature in Kelvin
  n = Number of electrons transferred
  F = Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol)
  [A], [B], [C], [D] = Concentrations of species

- At 298 K, the equation simplifies to:
  E = E° - (0.0591/n) log([C]ᶜ[D]ᵈ/[A]ᵃ[B]ᵇ)

2.3 Conductance of Electrolytic Solutions

2.3.1 Measurement of Conductivity
- Conductivity (κ): Ability of a solution to conduct electricity
- Units: S/m or S/cm (S = Siemens)
- Measured using a conductivity cell and Wheatstone bridge
- Cell constant (G*) = l/A, where l = distance between electrodes, A = area of electrodes
- Conductivity formula: κ = G*/R, where R = measured resistance

2.3.2 Molar Conductivity (Λₘ)
- Λₘ = κ/c, where c = concentration in mol/m³
- Units: S·m²/mol
- Variation with concentration:
  - Strong electrolytes: Λₘ increases slightly with dilution
  - Weak electrolytes: Λₘ increases sharply with dilution

2.3.3 Kohlrausch's Law
- Limiting molar conductivity (Λ°ₘ): Molar conductivity at infinite dilution
- For strong electrolytes: Λₘ = Λ°ₘ - A√c, where A is a constant
- Kohlrausch's Law: Λ°ₘ = ν₊λ°₊ + ν₋λ°₋
  Where:
  ν₊, ν₋ = Number of cations and anions
  λ°₊, λ°₋ = Limiting molar ionic conductivities of cation and anion

Key Terms:
- Anode: Electrode where oxidation occurs
- Cathode: Electrode where reduction occurs

2.4.1 Faraday's Laws of Electrolysis

First Law:
- The mass of substance produced at an electrode is directly proportional to the quantity of electricity passed through the electrolyte.
- m ∝ Q, where m = mass of substance, Q = quantity of electricity

Second Law:
- When the same quantity of electricity is passed through different electrolytes, the masses of substances produced are proportional to their chemical equivalents.
- m₁/E₁ = m₂/E₂, where m = mass, E = chemical equivalent weight

Faraday Constant (F):
- Charge carried by one mole of electrons
- F = 96,485 C/mol (often rounded to 96,500 C/mol for calculations)

Quantitative Aspects of Electrolysis:
- Quantity of electricity (Q) = Current (I) × Time (t)
- Q = I × t
- Number of moles of electrons (n) = Q / F
- Mass of substance produced (m) = (Q × M) / (n × F)
  Where M = Molar mass, n = Number of electrons in half-reaction
