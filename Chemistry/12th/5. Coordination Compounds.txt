Here are notes for Introduction, 5.1 to 5.3 for NEET, covering key terms, explanations, and formulas from the NCERT content:

Introduction to Coordination Compounds

- Coordination compounds: Compounds where metal atoms/ions are bound to a number of anions or neutral molecules
- Examples: Chlorophyll (Mg), hemoglobin (Fe), vitamin B₁₂ (Co)
- Applications: Metallurgy, industrial catalysts, analytical reagents, electroplating, textile dyeing, medicinal chemistry

5.1 Werner's Theory of Coordination Compounds

- Alfred Werner (1866-1919): Swiss chemist who developed the theory of coordination compounds
- Key concepts:
  1. Primary valence: Ionizable bonds (now known as oxidation state)
  2. Secondary valence: Non-ionizable bonds (now known as coordination number)
- Experimental basis: Studies on cobalt chloride-ammonia complexes
  - CoCl₃·6NH₃ (Yellow) gave 3 mol AgCl
  - CoCl₃·5NH₃ (Purple) gave 2 mol AgCl
  - CoCl₃·4NH₃ (Green) gave 1 mol AgCl
  - CoCl₃·4NH₃ (Violet) gave 1 mol AgCl
- Main postulates:
  1. Metals show two types of valences: primary and secondary
  2. Primary valences satisfied by negative ions
  3. Secondary valences satisfied by neutral molecules or negative ions
  4. Secondary valence equals coordination number (fixed for a metal)
  5. Coordinated groups have characteristic spatial arrangements
- Proposed geometrical shapes: Octahedral, tetrahedral, square planar

5.2 Definitions of Important Terms

a) Coordination entity: Central metal atom/ion bonded to a fixed number of ions/molecules
   Example: [CoCl₃(NH₃)₃]

b) Central atom/ion: The atom/ion to which a fixed number of ions/groups are bound
   Example: Co³⁺ in [Co(NH₃)₆]³⁺

c) Ligands: Ions or molecules bound to the central atom/ion
   Types:
   - Monodentate: Single donor atom (e.g., Cl⁻, H₂O, NH₃)
   - Bidentate: Two donor atoms (e.g., H₂NCH₂CH₂NH₂, C₂O₄²⁻)
   - Polydentate: Multiple donor atoms (e.g., EDTA⁴⁻)
   - Ambidentate: Can coordinate through different atoms (e.g., NO₂⁻, SCN⁻)

d) Coordination number: Number of ligand donor atoms directly bonded to the central metal atom/ion
   Example: 6 for [PtCl₆]²⁻, 4 for [Ni(NH₃)₄]²⁺

e) Coordination sphere: Central atom/ion and attached ligands enclosed in square brackets
   Example: [Fe(CN)₆]⁴⁻ in K₄[Fe(CN)₆]

f) Coordination polyhedron: Spatial arrangement of ligands around the central atom/ion
   Examples: Octahedral, square planar, tetrahedral

g) Oxidation number: Charge the central atom would have if all ligands were removed with their electron pairs
   Example: Cu(I) in [Cu(CN)₄]³⁻

h) Homoleptic complexes: Contains only one type of ligand (e.g., [Co(NH₃)₆]³⁺)
   Heteroleptic complexes: Contains more than one type of ligand (e.g., [Co(NH₃)₄Cl₂]⁺)

5.3 Nomenclature of Coordination Compounds

5.3.1 Formulas of Mononuclear Coordination Entities
Rules:
1. Central atom listed first
2. Ligands listed alphabetically
3. Polydentate ligands also listed alphabetically
4. Coordination entity enclosed in square brackets
5. No space between ligands and metal within coordination sphere
6. Charge indicated outside brackets (e.g., [Co(CN)₆]³⁻)

5.3.2 Naming of Mononuclear Coordination Compounds
Rules:
1. Cation named first
2. Ligands named alphabetically before central atom/ion
3. Anionic ligands end in '-o', neutral ligands unchanged (except aqua, ammine, carbonyl, nitrosyl)
4. Numerical prefixes: mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, hexa-
5. Oxidation state in Roman numerals
6. Anionic complex names end with '-ate' (some use Latin names, e.g., ferrate for Fe)

Examples:
- [Cr(NH₃)₃(H₂O)₃]Cl₃: Triamminetriaquachromium(III) chloride
- [Co(H₂NCH₂CH₂NH₂)₃]₂(SO₄)₃: Tris(ethane-1,2-diamine)cobalt(III) sulphate
- [Ag(NH₃)₂][Ag(CN)₂]: Diamminesilver(I) dicyanidoargentate(I)

Here are notes for sections 5.4 to 5.7 for NEET, covering key terms, explanations, and formulas from the NCERT content:

5.4 Isomerism in Coordination Compounds

Two main types:
A. Stereoisomerism
   1. Geometrical isomerism
      - Occurs in heteroleptic complexes
      - Examples:
        a) Square planar: cis- and trans-[PtCl₂(NH₃)₂]
        b) Octahedral: cis- and trans-[Co(NH₃)₄Cl₂]⁺
        c) Octahedral with bidentate ligands: cis- and trans-[CoCl₂(en)₂]⁺
        d) Facial (fac) and meridional (mer) isomers: [Co(NH₃)₃(NO₂)₃]

   2. Optical isomerism
      - Mirror images that cannot be superimposed
      - Examples: d- and l-[Co(en)₃]³⁺, cis-[PtCl₂(en)₂]²⁺

B. Structural isomerism
   1. Linkage isomerism: Different donor atoms of ambidentate ligand
      Example: [Co(NH₃)₅(NO₂)]Cl₂ (red) and [Co(NH₃)₅(ONO)]Cl₂ (yellow)

   2. Coordination isomerism: Interchange of ligands between cationic and anionic entities
      Example: [Co(NH₃)₆][Cr(CN)₆] and [Cr(NH₃)₆][Co(CN)₆]

   3. Ionisation isomerism: Different ions produced in solution
      Example: [Co(NH₃)₅SO₄]Br and [Co(NH₃)₅Br]SO₄

   4. Solvate isomerism: Different number of solvent molecules in coordination sphere
      Example: [Cr(H₂O)₆]Cl₃ (violet) and [Cr(H₂O)₅Cl]Cl₂·H₂O (grey-green)

5.5 Bonding in Coordination Compounds

5.5.1 Valence Bond Theory (VBT)
- Hybridization of central metal atom orbitals
- Overlap with ligand orbitals
- Explains geometry and magnetic properties
- Examples:
  a) [Co(NH₃)₆]³⁺: d²sp³ hybridization (inner orbital complex)
  b) [CoF₆]³⁻: sp³d² hybridization (outer orbital complex)
  c) [Ni(CN)₄]²⁻: dsp² hybridization (square planar)
  d) [NiCl₄]²⁻: sp³ hybridization (tetrahedral)

5.5.2 Magnetic Properties
- Determined by number of unpaired electrons
- Spin-only magnetic moment: μ = √n(n+2) BM, where n = number of unpaired electrons

5.5.3 Limitations of VBT
- Cannot explain color of complexes
- Cannot quantitatively interpret magnetic data

5.5.4 Crystal Field Theory (CFT)
- Considers electrostatic interactions between metal ion and ligands
- d-orbital splitting in different crystal fields:
  a) Octahedral: t₂g (d(xy), d(yz), d(xz)) and eg (d(z²), d(x²-y²))
  b) Tetrahedral: e and t₂
- Crystal field splitting energy (Δ₀ for octahedral, Δt for tetrahedral)
- Spectrochemical series: I⁻ < Br⁻ < SCN⁻ < Cl⁻ < S²⁻ < F⁻ < OH⁻ < C₂O₄²⁻ < H₂O < NCS⁻ < EDTA⁴⁻ < NH₃ < en < CN⁻ < CO

5.5.5 Colour in Coordination Compounds
- Due to d-d transitions
- Complementary color observed
- Example: [Ti(H₂O)₆]³⁺ absorbs blue-green light, appears violet

5.5.6 Limitations of CFT
- Does not consider covalent character of metal-ligand bond

5.6 Bonding in Metal Carbonyls

- Metal-carbon bond has both σ and π character
- Synergic effect: M→C σ bond and M←C π back-bonding
- Examples: Ni(CO)₄ (tetrahedral), Fe(CO)₅ (trigonal bipyramidal), Cr(CO)₆ (octahedral)

5.7 Importance and Applications of Coordination Compounds

1. Biological systems:
   - Chlorophyll (Mg), Hemoglobin (Fe), Vitamin B₁₂ (Co)
   - Enzymes: Carboxypeptidase A, Carbonic anhydrase

2. Analytical chemistry:
   - Qualitative and quantitative analysis
   - Hardness of water determination (EDTA titration)

3. Metallurgy:
   - Extraction of silver and gold
   - Purification of metals (e.g., Ni(CO)₄ decomposition)

4. Catalysis:
   - Wilkinson's catalyst [(Ph₃P)₃RhCl] for alkene hydrogenation

5. Electroplating:
   - Use of [Ag(CN)₂]⁻ and [Au(CN)₂]⁻ for smoother plating

6. Photography:
   - Fixing agent: Na₂S₂O₃ forms [Ag(S₂O₃)₂]³⁻

7. Medicinal chemistry:
   - Chelation therapy (e.g., EDTA for lead poisoning)
   - Anticancer drugs (e.g., cisplatin)
