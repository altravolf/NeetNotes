# **************************** Part 1 ******************************

Here are detailed notes for the Introduction, 5.1, and 5.2 sections, tailored for NEET preparation:

Introduction:
- Inheritance patterns and genetic basis were covered in the previous chapter
- This chapter focuses on the molecular basis of inheritance
- DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is the genetic material for most organisms
- RNA (ribonucleic acid) acts as genetic material in some viruses and mostly functions as a messenger
- RNA has additional roles: adapter, structural, and sometimes catalytic molecule

5.1 The DNA

Key Points:
- DNA is a long polymer of deoxyribonucleotides
- Length of DNA is measured in number of nucleotides or base pairs (bp)
- Examples of DNA lengths:
  • Bacteriophage φX174: 5,386 nucleotides
  • Bacteriophage lambda: 48,502 bp
  • Escherichia coli: 4.6 × 10^6 bp
  • Human haploid content: 3.3 × 10^9 bp

5.1.1 Structure of Polynucleotide Chain:
- Nucleotide components: nitrogenous base, pentose sugar, phosphate group
- Nitrogenous bases:
  • Purines: Adenine (A) and Guanine (G)
  • Pyrimidines: Cytosine (C), Uracil (U), and Thymine (T)
- Cytosine is common in both DNA and RNA
- Thymine is present in DNA, Uracil in RNA
- Nucleoside: nitrogenous base linked to pentose sugar through N-glycosidic linkage
- Nucleotide: nucleoside with a phosphate group linked to 5' C of sugar
- Polynucleotide chain: nucleotides linked through 3'-5' phosphodiester bonds
- 5' end: free phosphate group on 5' C of sugar
- 3' end: free OH group on 3' C of sugar

DNA Double Helix Structure:
- Proposed by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953
- Based on X-ray diffraction data by Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin
- Key features:
  1. Two polynucleotide chains with sugar-phosphate backbone
  2. Anti-parallel polarity of chains (5'→3' and 3'→5')
  3. Base pairing through hydrogen bonds: A-T (2 H-bonds), G-C (3 H-bonds)
  4. Right-handed coil
  5. Pitch: 3.4 nm (1 nm = 10^-9 m)
  6. 10 bp per turn
  7. Distance between bp: 0.34 nm
  8. Base pair stacking for stability

5.1.2 Packaging of DNA Helix:
- Human DNA length: ~2.2 meters (if stretched)
- Prokaryotic DNA packaging:
  • Nucleoid region
  • DNA associated with positively charged proteins
  • Organized in large loops
- Eukaryotic DNA packaging:
  • Histone proteins (positively charged, rich in lysine and arginine)
  • Histone octamer
  • Nucleosome: DNA wrapped around histone octamer (200 bp of DNA)
  • Chromatin: thread-like stained bodies in nucleus
  • "Beads-on-string" structure visible under electron microscope
  • Further coiling and condensation forms chromosomes
  • Non-histone Chromosomal (NHC) proteins involved in higher-level packaging
  • Euchromatin: loosely packed, lightly stained, transcriptionally active
  • Heterochromatin: densely packed, darkly stained, transcriptionally inactive

5.2 The Search for Genetic Material

Key Points:
- Friedrich Miescher identified "nuclein" (DNA) in 1869
- Genetic inheritance mechanism search reached molecular level by 1926

Griffith's Experiment (1928):
- Studied Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus)
- Smooth (S) strain: virulent, causes pneumonia, has polysaccharide coat
- Rough (R) strain: non-virulent, lacks polysaccharide coat
- Heat-killed S strain: non-virulent
- Mix of heat-killed S and live R strains: virulent, causes pneumonia
- Conclusion: "Transforming principle" transferred from heat-killed S to live R strain

Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty's Experiment (1944):
- Isolated different biochemicals from heat-killed S cells
- Tested each for ability to transform R cells into S cells
- Found that only DNA caused transformation
- Proved DNA is the genetic material

Hershey and Chase Experiment (1952):
- Used bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria)
- Grew phages with radioactive phosphorus (in DNA) or radioactive sulfur (in protein)
- Infected E. coli with radioactive phages
- Found that only radioactive DNA entered bacteria, not protein
- Conclusively proved DNA is the genetic material

Terms to remember:
- Nucleic acids, DNA, RNA
- Nucleotides, base pairs (bp)
- Purines, Pyrimidines
- Nucleoside, Phosphodiester bond
- Double helix, Anti-parallel
