- Examples:
  - Collagen: Most abundant protein in animals

Key points:
- Proteins are heteropolymers
- Some amino acids are essential (must be obtained from diet)

9.5 Polysaccharides

- Definition: Long chains of sugars (monosaccharides)
- Types:
  1. Homopolymers: Made of one type of monosaccharide (e.g., cellulose, starch, glycogen)
  2. Heteropolymers: Made of different monosaccharides (e.g., chitin)

Examples:
- Cellulose: Plant cell walls, cotton fiber, paper
- Starch: Energy storage in plants
- Glycogen: Energy storage in animals
- Inulin: Polymer of fructose
- Chitin: Exoskeletons of arthropods

Key points:
- Reducing end: Right end of polysaccharide chain
- Non-reducing end: Left end of polysaccharide chain
- Starch forms helical structures and can hold I2 molecules (blue color)
- Cellulose cannot hold I2

9.6 Nucleic Acids

- Definition: Polynucleotides composed of nucleotides
- Types: DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid)

Nucleotide components:
1. Nitrogenous base:
   - Purines: Adenine, Guanine
   - Pyrimidines: Cytosine, Thymine (DNA only), Uracil (RNA only)
2. Sugar: Deoxyribose (DNA) or Ribose (RNA)
3. Phosphate group

Key points:
- DNA contains deoxyribose sugar
- RNA contains ribose sugar

9.7 Structure of Proteins

Four levels of protein structure:

1. Primary structure:
   - Linear sequence of amino acids
   - N-terminal (first) and C-terminal (last) amino acids

2. Secondary structure:
   - Local folding of the protein chain
   - Examples: α-helix, β-pleated sheet

3. Tertiary structure:
   - Overall three-dimensional shape of a single protein molecule
   - Formed by folding and interactions between secondary structures

4. Quaternary structure:
   - Arrangement of multiple folded protein subunits
   - Example: Hemoglobin (2 α and 2 β subunits)

Key points:
- Only right-handed helices are observed in proteins
- Tertiary structure is crucial for protein function
- Some proteins consist of multiple subunits (quaternary structure)

These notes cover the main concepts, terms, and examples from topics 9.1 to 9.7 as presented in the NCERT text, providing a comprehensive overview for NEET preparation.









# ********************* Part 2 **********************

Here are concise notes for topic 9.8 (Enzymes) tailored for NEET preparation, including key terms, explanations, and examples from the NCERT text:

9.8 Enzymes

Definition: Proteins that catalyze chemical reactions in living organisms

Key points:
- Most enzymes are proteins
- Some RNA molecules (ribozymes) can act as enzymes
- Enzymes have an active site where the substrate binds

9.8.1 Chemical Reactions

- Physical change: Change in shape without breaking bonds (e.g., ice melting)
- Chemical reaction: Breaking and forming of bonds (e.g., hydrolysis of starch)
- Rate of reaction: Amount of product formed per unit time
- Metabolic pathway: Series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions

Example: Glucose → 2 Pyruvic acid (involves 10 enzyme-catalyzed reactions)

9.8.2 How Enzymes Bring About High Rates of Chemical Conversions

- Active site: Specific region on the enzyme where the substrate binds
- Substrate (S): The molecule on which the enzyme acts
- Product (P): The result of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction
- Enzyme-Substrate (ES) complex: Temporary structure formed when substrate binds to the enzyme
- Transition state: Unstable intermediate structure between substrate and product
- Activation energy: Energy barrier that must be overcome for a reaction to occur

Key concept: Enzymes lower the activation energy, increasing reaction rates

Example: Carbonic anhydrase
CO2 + H2O → H2CO3
Uncatalyzed: 200 molecules/hour
Enzyme-catalyzed: 600,000 molecules/second (10 million times faster)

9.8.3 Nature of Enzyme Action

Steps in enzyme catalysis:
1. Substrate binds to the active site
2. Enzyme changes shape to fit the substrate (induced fit)
3. Chemical bonds are broken/formed
4. Products are released
5. Enzyme is ready for next reaction

9.8.4 Factors Affecting Enzyme Activity

1. Temperature:
   - Optimum temperature: Temperature at which enzyme activity is highest
   - Low temperature: Preserves enzyme in inactive state
   - High temperature: Denatures enzyme

2. pH:
   - Optimum pH: pH at which enzyme activity is highest
   - Activity decreases above and below optimum pH

3. Substrate concentration:
   - Vmax: Maximum reaction velocity reached when all enzyme molecules are saturated with substrate
   - Km (Michaelis constant): Substrate concentration at which reaction rate is half of Vmax

4. Inhibitors:
   - Chemicals that bind to enzymes and reduce their activity
   - Competitive inhibitor: Resembles the substrate and competes for the active site
   Example: Malonate inhibits succinic dehydrogenase (resembles succinate)

9.8.5 Classification and Nomenclature of Enzymes

Six main classes:
1. Oxidoreductases/dehydrogenases: Catalyze oxidation-reduction reactions
2. Transferases: Transfer functional groups between molecules
3. Hydrolases: Catalyze hydrolysis reactions
4. Lyases: Remove groups from substrates, leaving double bonds
5. Isomerases: Catalyze structural rearrangements within a molecule
6. Ligases: Join two molecules, using energy from ATP

9.8.6 Co-factors

Definition: Non-protein components necessary for enzyme activity

Types:
1. Prosthetic groups:
   - Tightly bound organic compounds
   Example: Heme in peroxidase and catalase

2. Coenzymes:
   - Organic compounds with transient association
   - Often contain vitamins
   Example: NAD and NADP (contain niacin)

3. Metal ions:
   - Form coordination bonds at the active site
   Example: Zinc in carboxypeptidase

Key point: Enzyme activity is lost when co-factors are removed

These notes cover the main concepts, terms, and examples from topic 9.8 as presented in the NCERT text, providing a comprehensive overview of enzymes for NEET preparation.
