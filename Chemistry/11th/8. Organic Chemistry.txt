Here are the notes with subscripts formatted as requested:

Introduction to Organic Chemistry
- Study of compounds containing carbon
- Vital for life (DNA, proteins, blood, muscles, skin)
- Applications: clothing, fuels, polymers, dyes, medicines
- History: 
  - 1780s: Distinction between organic (from living sources) and inorganic compounds
  - 1828: Wöhler synthesized urea from inorganic compound (disproved "vital force" theory)
  - 1845: Kolbe synthesized acetic acid
  - 1856: Berthelot synthesized methane

8.1 General Introduction
- Catenation: Carbon's ability to form bonds with other carbon atoms
- Carbon forms covalent bonds with H, O, N, S, P, and halogens
- Organic compounds classified by structure or functional groups

8.2 Tetravalence of Carbon: Shapes of Organic Compounds

8.2.1 The Shapes of Carbon Compounds
- Hybridization: Mixing of atomic orbitals
  - sp³: Tetrahedral (e.g., methane CH₄)
  - sp²: Trigonal planar (e.g., ethene C₂H₄)
  - sp: Linear (e.g., ethyne C₂H₂)

- Bond characteristics:
  - sp³-s: Forms σ (sigma) bonds
  - sp²-sp²: Forms σ bonds
  - Unhybridized p orbitals: Form π (pi) bonds

8.2.2 Some Characteristic Features of π Bonds
- Require parallel p orbitals for proper sideways overlap
- Electron charge cloud above and below bonding plane
- More reactive than σ bonds
- Restricted rotation around C=C double bonds

8.3 Structural Representations of Organic Compounds

8.3.1 Complete, Condensed and Bond-line Structural Formulas
- Complete structural formula: Shows all bonds
- Condensed structural formula: Omits some or all dashes
- Bond-line structural formula: Uses lines to represent carbon chains

Examples:
Ethane: CH₃CH₃ (condensed), CH₃-CH₃ (complete)
Ethene: H₂C=CH₂ (condensed)
Ethyne: HC≡CH (condensed)

8.3.2 Three-Dimensional Representation of Organic Molecules
- Wedge and dash formula:
  Solid wedge (▲): Bond projecting out of plane
  Dashed wedge (┼): Bond projecting into plane
  Normal line (—): Bond in plane of paper

- Molecular models:
  1. Framework model: Shows only bonds
  2. Ball-and-stick model: Shows atoms (balls) and bonds (sticks)
  3. Space-filling model: Emphasizes relative atomic sizes

8.4 Classification of Organic Compounds

- Based on structure or functional groups

8.4.1 Functional Group
- Atom or group of atoms responsible for characteristic chemical properties
- Examples: -OH (alcohol), -CHO (aldehyde), -COOH (carboxylic acid)

8.4.2 Homologous Series
- Series of compounds with same functional group
- Differ by -CH₂ unit in molecular formula
- Examples: Alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids

Classification:
1. Acyclic (open chain) compounds
   - Aliphatic compounds (straight or branched chain)
   Example: CH₃-CH₂-CH₃ (propane)

2. Cyclic (closed chain) compounds
   a. Alicyclic compounds
      Example: Cyclohexane
   b. Aromatic compounds
      - Benzenoid: Contain benzene ring
        Example: Benzene (C₆H₆)
      - Non-benzenoid: Aromatic but not containing benzene ring
        Example: Tropone
   c. Heterocyclic compounds
      - Contains atoms other than carbon in the ring
      Example: Tetrahydrofuran

Key formulas:
1. Urea synthesis: NH₄CNO → NH₂CONH₂
2. Hybridization:
   - sp³: 4 σ bonds, tetrahedral, 109.5° bond angle
   - sp²: 3 σ bonds, 1 π bond, trigonal planar, 120° bond angle
   - sp: 2 σ bonds, 2 π bonds, linear, 180° bond angle

Remember to practice drawing structures and identifying functional groups for NEET preparation.

Here are the notes for sections 8.5 and 8.6, formatted for NEET preparation:

8.5 Nomenclature of Organic Compounds

8.5.1 The IUPAC System of Nomenclature
- IUPAC: International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry
- Systematic naming correlates structure with name

8.5.2 IUPAC Nomenclature of Alkanes
Rules for naming branched alkanes:
1. Identify longest carbon chain (parent chain)
2. Number the carbon atoms to give lowest numbers to substituents
3. Name alkyl groups as prefixes to parent alkane
4. Use di-, tri-, tetra- etc. for multiple identical substituents
5. List different substituents alphabetically
6. Use numbers to indicate substituent positions, separated by commas

Examples:
- CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃ : Octane
- (CH₃)₃C-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃ : 2,2,4-Trimethylpentane

Alkyl groups:
- Methyl (-CH₃), Ethyl (-CH₂CH₃), Propyl (-CH₂CH₂CH₃)
- Isopropyl [CH₃-CH(CH₃)-], sec-Butyl [CH₃-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-]
- Isobutyl [(CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-], tert-Butyl [(CH₃)₃C-]

Cyclic Compounds:
- Prefix "cyclo-" to the alkane name
Example: Cyclohexane, 3-Ethyl-1,1-dimethylcyclohexane

8.5.3 Nomenclature of Organic Compounds having Functional Group(s)
- Identify principal functional group (highest priority)
- Name parent chain including principal functional group
- Other groups named as prefixes

Functional Group Priorities (decreasing order):
-COOH, -SO₃H, -COOR, -COCl, -CONH₂, -CN, -CHO, >C=O, -OH, -NH₂, >C=C<, -C≡C-

Example: HOCH₂(CH₂)₃CH₂COCH₃ : 7-Hydroxyheptan-2-one

8.5.4 Nomenclature of Substituted Benzene Compounds
- Name substituents as prefixes to "benzene"
- For disubstituted: Use numbers or ortho- (1,2), meta- (1,3), para- (1,4)
- For tri- or higher substituted: Use numbers only

Examples:
- Methylbenzene (Toluene)
- 1,3-Dibromobenzene (m-Dibromobenzene)
- 4-Ethyl-2-methylaniline

8.6 Isomerism

Definition: Compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures

Types of Isomerism:
1. Structural Isomerism
   a. Chain Isomerism
      - Different carbon skeletons
      Example: C₅H₁₂ (n-pentane, isopentane, neopentane)

   b. Position Isomerism
      - Different positions of substituent/functional group
      Example: C₃H₈O (Propan-1-ol, Propan-2-ol)

   c. Functional Group Isomerism
      - Different functional groups
      Example: C₃H₆O (Propanal, Propanone)

   d. Metamerism
      - Different alkyl chains on either side of functional group
      Example: C₄H₁₀O (CH₃OC₃H₇, C₂H₅OC₂H₅)

2. Stereoisomerism
   a. Geometrical Isomerism
      - Different spatial arrangements of groups around C=C or rings
   
   b. Optical Isomerism
      - Non-superimposable mirror images

Key Points for NEET:
- Practice drawing structures for all types of isomers
- Understand the differences between various types of isomerism
- Be able to identify and name isomers given molecular formulas or structures
- Know how to determine the number of possible isomers for a given molecular formula

Remember to practice problems involving nomenclature and isomerism, as these are important topics for NEET.
