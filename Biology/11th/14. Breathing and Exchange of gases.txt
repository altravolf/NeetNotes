Here are detailed notes on section 14.1 Respiratory Organs, tailored for NEET preparation:

14.1 Respiratory Organs

1. Breathing mechanisms vary among animals based on:
   - Habitat
   - Level of organization

2. Gas exchange in different organisms:
   a) Lower invertebrates (e.g., sponges, coelenterates, flatworms):
      - Use simple diffusion over entire body surface
      - Exchange O₂ with CO₂

   b) Earthworms:
      - Use moist cuticle for gas exchange

   c) Insects:
      - Have a network of tubes called tracheal tubes
      - Transport atmospheric air within the body

   d) Aquatic arthropods and molluscs:
      - Use gills (branchial respiration)
      - Gills are specialized vascularized structures

   e) Terrestrial animals:
      - Use lungs (pulmonary respiration)
      - Lungs are vascularized bags

   f) Vertebrates:
      - Fishes: Use gills
      - Amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals: Use lungs
      - Amphibians (e.g., frogs): Can also respire through moist skin (cutaneous respiration)

14.1.1 Human Respiratory System

1. External nostrils:
   - Open above upper lips
   - Lead to nasal chamber through nasal passage

2. Nasal chamber:
   - Opens into pharynx

3. Pharynx:
   - Common passage for food and air

4. Larynx:
   - Cartilaginous box
   - Helps in sound production (also called sound box)
   - Contains glottis, which can be covered by epiglottis during swallowing

5. Trachea:
   - Straight tube extending to mid-thoracic cavity
   - Divides at 5th thoracic vertebra into right and left primary bronchi

6. Bronchi:
   - Undergo repeated divisions
   - Form secondary and tertiary bronchi, and bronchioles
   - End in very thin terminal bronchioles

7. Alveoli:
   - Thin, irregular-walled, vascularized bag-like structures
   - Arise from terminal bronchioles

8. Lungs:
   - Consist of bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli network
   - Two lungs present
   - Covered by double-layered pleura with pleural fluid between layers
   - Pleural fluid reduces friction on lung surface

9. Thoracic chamber:
   - Air-tight chamber containing lungs
   - Formed by:
     a) Vertebral column (dorsally)
     b) Sternum (ventrally)
     c) Ribs (laterally)
     d) Diaphragm (lower side, dome-shaped)

10. Parts of respiratory system:
    a) Conducting part:
       - From external nostrils to terminal bronchioles
       - Functions: Transport air, clear foreign particles, humidify air, bring air to body temperature
    b) Respiratory/Exchange part:
       - Alveoli and their ducts
       - Site of actual diffusion of O₂ and CO₂ between blood and atmospheric air

Key terms to remember:
- Branchial respiration: Gas exchange using gills
- Pulmonary respiration: Gas exchange using lungs
- Cutaneous respiration: Gas exchange through skin
- Tracheal tubes: Network of tubes in insects for air transport
- Epiglottis: Thin elastic cartilaginous flap covering glottis during swallowing
- Pleura: Double-layered membrane covering lungs
- Pleural fluid: Fluid between pleural layers, reduces friction

Note: This section provides a comprehensive overview of respiratory organs across different organisms and a detailed description of the human respiratory system. Understanding the structure and function of each component is crucial for NEET preparation.

Here are detailed notes for sections 14.2 to 14.6, tailored for NEET preparation:

14.2 Mechanism of Breathing

1. Breathing stages:
   a) Inspiration: Drawing in atmospheric air
   b) Expiration: Releasing alveolar air

2. Breathing mechanism:
   - Based on pressure gradients between lungs and atmosphere
   - Inspiration occurs when intra-pulmonary pressure < atmospheric pressure
   - Expiration occurs when intra-pulmonary pressure > atmospheric pressure

3. Muscles involved:
   - Diaphragm
   - External intercostal muscles
   - Internal intercostal muscles

4. Inspiration process:
   - Diaphragm contracts (increases thoracic volume in antero-posterior axis)
   - External intercostal muscles contract (lift ribs and sternum, increasing thoracic volume in dorso-ventral axis)
   - Increased thoracic volume → increased pulmonary volume → decreased intra-pulmonary pressure
   - Air moves into lungs

5. Expiration process:
   - Diaphragm and intercostal muscles relax
   - Thoracic and pulmonary volumes reduce
   - Intra-pulmonary pressure increases
   - Air is expelled from lungs

6. Breathing rate: 12-16 times/minute in a healthy human

14.2.1 Respiratory Volumes and Capacities

1. Tidal Volume (TV):
   - Air volume inspired or expired during normal respiration
   - Approx. 500 mL

2. Inspiratory Reserve Volume (IRV):
   - Additional air volume that can be inspired forcibly
   - 2500-3000 mL

3. Expiratory Reserve Volume (ERV):
   - Additional air volume that can be expired forcibly
   - 1000-1100 mL

4. Residual Volume (RV):
   - Air volume remaining in lungs after forcible expiration
   - 1100-1200 mL

5. Inspiratory Capacity (IC):
   - TV + IRV

6. Expiratory Capacity (EC):
   - TV + ERV

7. Functional Residual Capacity (FRC):
   - ERV + RV

8. Vital Capacity (VC):
   - Maximum air volume that can be breathed out after forced inspiration
   - IRV + TV + ERV

9. Total Lung Capacity (TLC):
   - RV + ERV + TV + IRV
   - Or, Vital Capacity + Residual Volume

14.3 Exchange of Gases

1. Primary sites: Alveoli

2. Other sites: Between blood and tissues

3. Mechanism: Simple diffusion based on pressure/concentration gradient

4. Factors affecting diffusion:
   - Pressure gradient
   - Solubility of gases
   - Thickness of membranes

5. Partial pressure:
   - Pressure contributed by an individual gas in a mixture
   - Represented as pO₂ for oxygen and pCO₂ for carbon dioxide

6. Concentration gradients:
   - O₂: Alveoli → Blood → Tissues
   - CO₂: Tissues → Blood → Alveoli

7. Diffusion membrane structure:
   - Thin squamous epithelium of alveoli
   - Endothelium of alveolar capillaries
   - Basement substance (composed of thin basement membranes)
   - Total thickness < 1 mm

14.4 Transport of Gases

1. Oxygen transport:
   - 97% by RBCs
   - 3% dissolved in plasma

2. CO₂ transport:
   - 20-25% by RBCs
   - 70% as bicarbonate
   - 7% dissolved in plasma

14.4.1 Transport of Oxygen

1. Haemoglobin:
   - Red, iron-containing pigment in RBCs
   - Can bind 4 O₂ molecules reversibly (forms oxyhaemoglobin)

2. Factors affecting O₂ binding:
   - Partial pressure of O₂
   - Partial pressure of CO₂
   - H⁺ concentration
   - Temperature

3. Oxygen dissociation curve:
   - Sigmoid curve
   - Shows percentage saturation of haemoglobin with O₂ against pO₂

4. O₂ delivery:
   - 100 mL oxygenated blood delivers ~5 mL O₂ to tissues under normal conditions

14.4.2 Transport of Carbon Dioxide

1. Carbamino-haemoglobin:
   - 20-25% of CO₂ carried by haemoglobin
   - Binding affected by pCO₂ and pO₂

2. Carbonic anhydrase:
   - Enzyme present in high concentration in RBCs
   - Facilitates CO₂ + H2O ⇌ H2CO3 ⇌ HCO₃⁻ + H⁺

3. CO₂ transport mechanism:
   - At tissue site: CO₂ diffuses into blood, forms HCO₃⁻ and H⁺
   - At alveolar site: Reaction reverses, releasing CO₂

4. CO₂ delivery:
   - 100 mL deoxygenated blood delivers ~4 mL CO₂ to alveoli

14.5 Regulation of Respiration

1. Respiratory rhythm centre:
   - Located in medulla region of brain
   - Primary regulator of respiratory rhythm

2. Pneumotaxic centre:
   - Located in pons region of brain
   - Moderates functions of respiratory rhythm centre
   - Can reduce inspiration duration and alter respiratory rate

3. Chemosensitive area:
   - Adjacent to rhythm centre
   - Sensitive to CO₂ and H⁺ ions
   - Activates rhythm centre to adjust respiration when these substances increase

4. Other receptors:
   - Associated with aortic arch and carotid artery
   - Recognize changes in CO₂ and H⁺ concentration
   - Send signals to rhythm centre for adjustments

5. Role of oxygen:
   - Insignificant in regulating respiratory rhythm

14.6 Disorders of Respiratory System

1. Asthma:
   - Difficulty in breathing causing wheezing
   - Due to inflammation of bronchi and bronchioles

2. Emphysema:
   - Chronic disorder
   - Alveolar walls damaged, decreasing respiratory surface
   - Major cause: Cigarette smoking

3. Occupational Respiratory Disorders:
   - Caused by long exposure to industrial dust (e.g., in grinding or stone-breaking industries)
   - Can lead to inflammation and fibrosis (proliferation of fibrous tissues)
   - Prevention: Workers should wear protective masks

Key terms to remember:
- Inspiration/Expiration
