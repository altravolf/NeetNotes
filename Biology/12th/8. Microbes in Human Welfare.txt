8.3 Microbes in Sewage Treatment

1. Sewage: Municipal waste-water containing human excreta, organic matter, and pathogenic microbes

2. Treatment Process:
   a) Primary treatment (Physical):
      - Filtration: Removes floating debris
      - Sedimentation: Removes grit (soil and small pebbles)
      - Result: Primary sludge (settled solids) and effluent (supernatant)

   b) Secondary treatment (Biological):
      - Aeration tanks: Effluent is agitated and aerated
      - Microbes form flocs (mesh-like structures of bacteria and fungal filaments)
      - Microbes consume organic matter, reducing Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)
      - BOD: Amount of oxygen consumed if all organic matter in one liter of water were oxidized by bacteria
      - Lower BOD indicates less polluting potential

   c) Anaerobic sludge digestion:
      - Anaerobic bacteria digest the sludge
      - Produces biogas (mixture of methane, hydrogen sulfide, and carbon dioxide)

3. Environmental Impact:
   - Treated effluent released into natural water bodies
   - Untreated sewage leads to water pollution and water-borne diseases

4. Government Initiatives:
   - Ganga Action Plan and Yamuna Action Plan
   - Aim: Build more sewage treatment plants to reduce river pollution

These notes cover the key points, terms, and examples from the introduction and sections 8.1 to 8.3 of the NCERT chapter on Microbes in Human Welfare, formatted for NEET preparation.
