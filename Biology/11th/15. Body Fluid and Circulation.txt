# **************************** Part 1 ****************************

Here are concise notes for the Introduction, 15.1, and 15.2 topics, tailored for NEET preparation:

Introduction:
- Living cells require nutrients, O2, and other essential substances
- Waste products need to be removed for healthy functioning
- Different organisms have evolved various transport mechanisms
- Simple organisms (e.g., sponges, coelenterates) circulate water through body cavities
- Complex organisms use special fluids (blood, lymph) for transport

15.1 Blood:
- Special connective tissue
- Composed of fluid matrix (plasma) and formed elements

15.1.1 Plasma:
- Straw-colored, viscous fluid (55% of blood)
- Composition: 90-92% water, 6-8% proteins
- Major proteins: Fibrinogen, globulins, albumins
  - Fibrinogen: Essential for blood clotting
  - Globulins: Involved in defense mechanisms
  - Albumins: Help maintain osmotic balance
- Contains minerals: Na+, Ca++, Mg++, HCO3–, Cl–
- Also contains glucose, amino acids, lipids
- Clotting factors present in inactive form
- Serum: Plasma without clotting factors

15.1.2 Formed Elements:
1. Erythrocytes (RBCs):
   - Most abundant blood cells
   - Normal count: 5-5.5 million/mm3
   - Biconcave shape, no nucleus (in mammals)
   - Contain hemoglobin (12-16 g/100 mL blood)
   - Function: Gas transport (O2 and CO2)
   - Lifespan: 120 days
   - Destroyed in spleen ("graveyard of RBCs")

2. Leucocytes (WBCs):
   - Nucleated, colorless cells
   - Normal count: 6000-8000/mm3
   - Types:
     a. Granulocytes:
        - Neutrophils (60-65%): Phagocytic, destroy foreign organisms
        - Eosinophils (2-3%): Resist infections, involved in allergic reactions
        - Basophils (0.5-1%): Secrete histamine, serotonin, heparin; involved in inflammatory reactions
     b. Agranulocytes:
        - Lymphocytes (20-25%): B and T types, responsible for immune responses
        - Monocytes (6-8%): Phagocytic, destroy foreign organisms

3. Platelets (Thrombocytes):
   - Cell fragments from megakaryocytes
   - Normal count: 1,500,00-3,500,00/mm3
   - Function: Blood clotting

15.1.3 Blood Groups:
15.1.3.1 ABO grouping:
- Based on presence/absence of surface antigens A and B on RBCs
- Four blood groups: A, B, AB, O
- Plasma contains natural antibodies
- Universal donor: O group
- Universal recipient: AB group

15.1.3.2 Rh grouping:
- Based on presence/absence of Rh antigen on RBCs
- Rh+ve (80% of population) and Rh-ve
- Rh incompatibility: Can occur between Rh-ve mother and Rh+ve fetus
- Erythroblastosis foetalis: Condition caused by Rh incompatibility
- Prevention: Administering anti-Rh antibodies to Rh-ve mother after first delivery

15.1.4 Coagulation of Blood:
- Process to prevent excessive blood loss
- Forms a clot (coagulum) at the site of injury
- Composition of clot: Fibrin threads, trapped blood cells
- Coagulation cascade:
  Inactive Fibrinogen → Fibrin (by Thrombin)
  Inactive Prothrombin → Thrombin (by Thrombokinase)
- Requires calcium ions
- Triggered by platelets and tissue factors at injury site

15.2 Lymph (Tissue Fluid):
- Formed from blood plasma that leaks out of capillaries
- Similar mineral composition to plasma
- Functions:
  1. Medium for exchange between blood and cells
  2. Returns proteins to blood
  3. Carries lymphocytes for immune responses
  4. Absorbs fats (through lacteals in intestinal villi)

These notes cover all the key terms, explanations, and examples provided in the NCERT text for the introduction, blood, and lymph topics. They are concise yet comprehensive, making them suitable for NEET preparation.





# ***************************** Part 2 ******************************

Here are concise notes for topics 15.3 to 15.6, tailored for NEET preparation:

15.3 Circulatory Pathways:

Types of circulatory systems:
1. Open circulatory system:
   - Found in arthropods and molluscs
   - Blood pumped into open spaces (sinuses)

2. Closed circulatory system:
   - Found in annelids and chordates
   - Blood always within blood vessels
   - More precise regulation of blood flow

Vertebrate hearts:
- Fishes: 2-chambered (1 atrium, 1 ventricle)
- Amphibians and reptiles (except crocodiles): 3-chambered (2 atria, 1 ventricle)
- Crocodiles, birds, mammals: 4-chambered (2 atria, 2 ventricles)

Types of circulation:
- Single circulation: Fishes
- Incomplete double circulation: Amphibians, reptiles
- Complete double circulation: Birds, mammals

15.3.1 Human Circulatory System:
Heart:
- Location: Thoracic cavity between lungs, slightly tilted left
- Size: Clenched fist
- Protection: Double-walled pericardium with pericardial fluid
- Chambers: 2 atria (upper), 2 ventricles (lower)
- Septa: Interatrial, interventricular, atrioventricular
- Valves:
  - Tricuspid: Between right atrium and ventricle
  - Bicuspid/Mitral: Between left atrium and ventricle
  - Semilunar: At the base of pulmonary artery and aorta

Nodal tissue:
- Sino-atrial node (SAN): Right upper corner of right atrium
- Atrio-ventricular node (AVN): Lower left corner of right atrium
- AV bundle: Continues from AVN, divides into right and left branches
- Purkinje fibers: Minute fibers throughout ventricular walls

15.3.2 Cardiac Cycle:
- Duration: 0.8 seconds
- Phases:
  1. Joint diastole (all chambers relaxed)
  2. Atrial systole (SAN generates action potential)
  3. Ventricular systole (ventricles contract)
  4. Ventricular diastole (ventricles relax)

Key terms:
- Stroke volume: Blood pumped per ventricle per beat (~70 mL)
- Cardiac output: Blood pumped per ventricle per minute (~5000 mL or 5 L)
- Heart sounds: "Lub" (tricuspid/bicuspid valve closure), "Dub" (semilunar valve closure)

15.3.3 Electrocardiograph (ECG):
- Graphical representation of heart's electrical activity
- Standard ECG: Three leads (wrists and left ankle)
- Waves:
  - P-wave: Atrial depolarization
  - QRS complex: Ventricular depolarization
  - T-wave: Ventricular repolarization

15.4 Double Circulation:

Blood vessels:
- Structure: Three layers (tunica intima, media, externa)
- Types: Arteries, veins (thinner tunica media)

Circulatory pathways:
1. Pulmonary circulation:
   Right ventricle → Pulmonary artery → Lungs → Pulmonary veins → Left atrium

2. Systemic circulation:
   Left ventricle → Aorta → Body tissues → Venae cavae → Right atrium

Special circulations:
- Hepatic portal system: Intestine → Liver → Systemic circulation
- Coronary circulation: Exclusively for cardiac musculature

15.5 Regulation of Cardiac Activity:
- Intrinsic regulation: Myogenic (auto-regulated by nodal tissue)
- Extrinsic regulation:
  1. Neural: Medulla oblongata via Autonomic Nervous System (ANS)
     - Sympathetic nerves: Increase heart rate and cardiac output
     - Parasympathetic nerves: Decrease heart rate and cardiac output
  2. Hormonal: Adrenal medullary hormones increase cardiac output

15.6 Disorders of Circulatory System:

1. Hypertension (High Blood Pressure):
   - Normal BP: 120/80 mm Hg
   - Hypertension: ≥140/90 mm Hg
   - Effects: Heart diseases, damage to brain and kidney

2. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD):
   - Also called atherosclerosis
   - Narrowing of coronary arteries due to deposits of calcium, fat, cholesterol, and fibrous tissues

3. Angina:
   - Also called 'angina pectoris'
   - Symptom: Acute chest pain due to insufficient oxygen supply to heart muscle
   - More common in middle-aged and elderly

4. Heart Failure:
   - Ineffective pumping of blood by heart
   - Also called congestive heart failure
   - Not the same as cardiac arrest or heart attack

These notes cover all key terms, explanations, and examples from the NCERT text for topics 15.3 to 15.6, providing a comprehensive yet concise resource for NEET preparation.
