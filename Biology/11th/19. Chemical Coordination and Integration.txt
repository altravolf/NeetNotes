Here are detailed notes for topics 19.1 to 19.2.5, tailored for NEET preparation:

19.1 Endocrine Glands and Hormones

• Endocrine glands: Ductless glands that secrete hormones directly into the bloodstream.
• Hormones: Non-nutrient chemicals acting as intercellular messengers, produced in trace amounts.
• New definition of hormones: Includes molecules beyond those secreted by organized endocrine glands.
• Invertebrates: Have simple endocrine systems with few hormones.
• Vertebrates: Have complex endocrine systems with many hormones for coordination.

19.2 Human Endocrine System

Major components:
1. Organized endocrine glands: Pituitary, pineal, thyroid, adrenal, pancreas, parathyroid, thymus, and gonads (testis in males, ovary in females)
2. Other hormone-producing organs: Gastrointestinal tract, liver, kidney, heart

  1. Releasing hormones: Stimulate pituitary hormone secretion
  2. Inhibiting hormones: Inhibit pituitary hormone secretion
• Example: Gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulates gonadotrophin synthesis and release
• Example: Somatostatin inhibits growth hormone release
• Hormone transport: Through axons to nerve endings, then to pituitary via portal circulation
• Regulation: Direct neural regulation of posterior pituitary

19.2.2 The Pituitary Gland
