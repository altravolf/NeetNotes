Introduction to Haloalkanes and Haloarenes

- Haloalkanes: Hydrocarbons with halogen atom(s) replacing hydrogen
- Haloarenes: Aromatic compounds with halogen atom(s) attached
- General formula for haloalkanes: CₙH₂ₙ₊₁X (X = F, Cl, Br, I)
- Applications: Solvents, starting materials for organic synthesis
- Examples of naturally occurring halogen compounds:
  - Chloramphenicol (antibiotic)
  - Thyroxine (hormone)
- Synthetic halogen compounds:
  - Chloroquine (antimalarial)
  - Halothane (anesthetic)

6.1 Classification

6.1.1 Based on Number of Halogen Atoms

c) Addition of halogens to alkenes
   CH₂=CH₂ + Br₂ → CH₂Br-CH₂Br

6.4.3 Halogen Exchange

- Haloarenes: Aromatic compounds with halogen atoms directly attached to the ring
- Nucleophilic substitution: Reaction where a nucleophile replaces a leaving group
- Electrophilic substitution: Reaction where an electrophile replaces a hydrogen atom on an aromatic ring
- Markovnikov's rule: In addition reactions, the electrophile adds to the carbon with more hydrogen atoms

6.7 Chemical Reactions

6.7.1 Reactions of Haloalkanes

1. Nucleophilic Substitution Reactions
   - Definition: Nucleophile replaces the halogen atom
   - Types: SN1 and SN2 mechanisms

   a) SN2 Mechanism (Substitution Nucleophilic Bimolecular)
      - One-step process
      - Rate depends on concentration of both substrate and nucleophile
      - Inversion of configuration occurs
      - Example: CH₃Br + OH⁻ → CH₃OH + Br⁻
      - Reactivity order: Primary > Secondary > Tertiary

   b) SN1 Mechanism (Substitution Nucleophilic Unimolecular)
      - Two-step process
      - Rate depends only on concentration of substrate
      - Carbocation intermediate formed
      - Racemization occurs
      - Example: (CH₃)₃CBr + H₂O → (CH₃)₃COH + H⁺ + Br⁻
      - Reactivity order: Tertiary > Secondary > Primary

   c) Stereochemistry of nucleophilic substitution
      - Chirality: Non-superimposable mirror images
      - Optical activity: Rotation of plane-polarized light
      - Enantiomers: Stereoisomers that are mirror images
      - Racemic mixture: Equal mixture of enantiomers

2. Elimination Reactions
   - Dehydrohalogenation: Removal of HX to form alkenes
   - Example: CH₃-CH₂-Br + KOH → CH₂=CH₂ + KBr + H₂O
   - Zaitsev's rule: Major product has more substituted double bond

3. Reaction with Metals
   a) Grignard Reagent Formation
      - RX + Mg → RMgX (in dry ether)
      - Used in organic synthesis

   b) Wurtz Reaction
      - 2R-X + 2Na → R-R + 2NaX
      - Forms higher alkanes

6.7.2 Reactions of Haloarenes

1. Nucleophilic Substitution
   - Difficult due to resonance stability and shorter C-X bond
   - Activated by electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., -NO₂)
   - Example: p-NO₂-C₆H₄-Cl + NaOH → p-NO₂-C₆H₄-OH + NaCl

2. Electrophilic Substitution
   - Halogen acts as deactivating and ortho-para directing group
   - Examples:
     a) Halogenation: C₆H₅Cl + Cl₂ → o-C₆H₄Cl₂ + p-C₆H₄Cl₂
     b) Nitration: C₆H₅Cl + HNO₃ + H₂SO₄ → o-NO₂C₆H₄Cl + p-NO₂C₆H₄Cl
     c) Sulphonation: C₆H₅Br + H₂SO₄ → o-BrC₆H₄SO₃H + p-BrC₆H₄SO₃H
     d) Friedel-Crafts alkylation: C₆H₅Cl + CH₃Cl → o-CH₃C₆H₄Cl + p-CH₃C₆H₄Cl

3. Reaction with Metals
   a) Wurtz-Fittig Reaction
      - C₆H₅Cl + 2Na + CH₃Cl → C₆H₅-CH₃ + 2NaCl
   b) Fittig Reaction
