Introduction to Redox Reactions
- Redox reactions: Chemical reactions involving oxidation and reduction occurring simultaneously
- Important in various fields: pharmaceutical, biological, industrial, metallurgical, and agricultural

7.1 Classical Idea of Redox Reactions - Oxidation and Reduction Reactions

1. Oxidation:
   - Originally: Addition of oxygen to an element or compound
   - Examples: 
     2Mg(s) + O₂(g) → 2MgO(s)
     S(s) + O₂(g) → SO₂(g)
     CH₄(g) + 2O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + 2H₂O(l)
   - Extended definition: Removal of hydrogen from a substance
   - Example: 2H₂S(g) + O₂(g) → 2S(s) + 2H₂O(l)

2. Reduction:
   - Originally: Removal of oxygen from a compound
   - Example: 2HgO(s) → 2Hg(l) + O₂(g)
   - Extended definition: Addition of hydrogen to a substance
   - Example: CH₂=CH₂(g) + H₂(g) → H₃C-CH₃(g)

3. Oxidizing agent (oxidant): 
   - Substance that oxidizes another substance
   - Accepts electrons in the reaction

4. Reducing agent (reductant):
   - Substance that reduces another substance
   - Donates electrons in the reaction

5. Redox reaction: 
   - Reaction where oxidation and reduction occur simultaneously

7.2 Redox Reactions in Terms of Electron Transfer Reactions

1. Oxidation: Loss of electrons by a species
   Example: Na(s) → Na⁺(g) + e⁻

2. Reduction: Gain of electrons by a species
   Example: Cl₂(g) + 2e⁻ → 2Cl⁻(g)

3. Oxidizing agent: Acceptor of electrons

4. Reducing agent: Donor of electrons

7.2.1 Competitive Electron Transfer Reactions

- Reactions where metals compete to release electrons
- Examples:
  a. Zn(s) + Cu²⁺(aq) → Zn²⁺(aq) + Cu(s)
  b. Cu(s) + 2Ag⁺(aq) → Cu²⁺(aq) + 2Ag(s)
  c. Zn(s) + 2Ag⁺(aq) → Zn²⁺(aq) + 2Ag(s)

- Electron releasing tendency: Zn > Cu > Ag

Key Terms:

1. Redox couple: Oxidized and reduced forms of a substance in a half-reaction
   Example: Zn²⁺/Zn, Cu²⁺/Cu

2. Standard Electrode Potential (E°): 
   - Potential of an electrode at 298K, 1M concentration, and 1 atm pressure
   - Measured with respect to Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE)
   - SHE has an E° value of 0.00 volts

3. Electrochemical series: 
   - Arrangement of elements based on their standard electrode potentials
   - Helps predict the feasibility of redox reactions

Note: For NEET, focus on understanding the concepts, recognizing redox reactions, identifying oxidizing and reducing agents, and predicting the direction of electron transfer in competitive reactions.

Here are concise notes for sections 7.3 and 7.4, tailored for NEET preparation:

7.3 Oxidation Number

- Oxidation number: The charge an atom would have if the compound was composed of ions
- Rules for assigning oxidation numbers:
  1. Free elements have oxidation number of 0
  2. For monatomic ions, oxidation number equals the charge on the ion
  3. Oxygen usually has -2, except in peroxides (-1) and F₂O (+2)
  4. Hydrogen usually has +1, except in metal hydrides (-1)
  5. Fluorine always has -1 in compounds
  6. Sum of oxidation numbers in a neutral compound is 0
  7. Sum of oxidation numbers in a polyatomic ion equals its charge

7.3.1 Types of Redox Reactions

1. Combination reactions: A + B → C
   Example: 2Mg(s) + O₂(g) → 2MgO(s)

2. Decomposition reactions: C → A + B
   Example: 2H₂O(l) → 2H₂(g) + O₂(g)

3. Displacement reactions: X + YZ → XZ + Y
   a. Metal displacement: Cu²⁺(aq) + Zn(s) → Cu(s) + Zn²⁺(aq)
   b. Non-metal displacement: Cl₂(g) + 2KBr(aq) → 2KCl(aq) + Br₂(l)

4. Disproportionation reactions: 
   Example: 3Cl₂(g) + 6OH⁻(aq) → 5Cl⁻(aq) + ClO₃⁻(aq) + 3H₂O(l)

7.3.2 Balancing of Redox Reactions

Two methods:
1. Oxidation number method
2. Half-reaction method

Steps for half-reaction method:
1. Write unbalanced ionic equation
2. Separate into half-reactions
3. Balance atoms other than H and O
4. Balance O by adding H₂O
5. Balance H by adding H⁺
6. Balance charges by adding electrons
7. Equalize electrons in both half-reactions
8. Add half-reactions and cancel common terms

7.3.3 Redox Reactions as the Basis for Titrations

- Redox titrations use redox reactions to determine concentration
- Indicators: 
  1. Self-indicators (e.g., KMnO₄)
  2. External indicators (e.g., starch for I₂)

7.3.4 Limitations of Concept of Oxidation Number

- Does not always accurately represent electron distribution
- Fractional oxidation numbers can occur in some compounds

7.4 Redox Reactions and Electrode Processes

- Electrochemical cell: Device that converts chemical energy to electrical energy
- Components:
  1. Anode: Negative electrode where oxidation occurs
  2. Cathode: Positive electrode where reduction occurs
  3. Salt bridge: Maintains electrical neutrality
  4. External circuit: Allows electron flow

- Daniell cell: Zn|Zn²⁺ || Cu²⁺|Cu
  Anode reaction: Zn(s) → Zn²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻
  Cathode reaction: Cu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → Cu(s)
  Overall reaction: Zn(s) + Cu²⁺(aq) → Zn²⁺(aq) + Cu(s)

Key Terms:
1. Electrode potential: Tendency of an electrode to gain or lose electrons
2. Standard electrode potential (E°): Electrode potential under standard conditions
3. Electrochemical series: Arrangement of elements based on their standard electrode potentials
4. Nernst equation: Relates electrode potential to concentration of species involved

E = E° - (RT/nF) ln Q

Where:
E = Cell potential
E° = Standard cell potential
R = Gas constant
T = Temperature in Kelvin
n = Number of electrons transferred
F = Faraday constant
Q = Reaction quotient

Note for NEET: Focus on understanding the concept of oxidation numbers, balancing redox reactions, and the basics of electrochemical cells. Be familiar with common redox reactions and their applications in electrochemistry.
